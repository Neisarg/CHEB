of function.
! Functions All Around Us
In nearly every physical phenomenon we observe that one quantity depends on another.
For example, your height depends on your age, the temperature depends on the date, the
cost of mailing a package depends on its weight (see Figure 1). We use the term function
to describe this dependence of one quantity on another. That is, we say the following:
" Height is a function of age.
" Temperature is a function of date.
" Cost of mailing a package is a function of weight.
The U.S. Post Office uses a simple rule to determine the cost of mailing a first-class par-
cel on the basis of its weight. But it's not so easy to describe the rule that relates height
to age or the rule that relates temperature to date.

F I G U R E  1 Height is a function of age. Temperature is a function of date. Postage is a function of weight.
Can you think of other functions? Here are some more examples:
" The area of a circle is a function of its radius.
" The number of bacteria in a culture is a function of time.
" The weight of an astronaut is a function of her elevation.
" The price of a commodity is a function of the demand for that commodity.
The rule that describes how the area A of a circle depends on its radius r is given by
the formula A ! pr2. Even when a precise rule or formula describing a function is not
available, we can still describe the function by a graph. For example, when you turn on a
hot water faucet, the temperature of the water depends on how long the water has been
running. So we can say:
" The temperature of water from the faucet is a function of time.
Figure 2 shows a rough graph of the temperature T of the water as a function of the time
t that has elapsed since the faucet was turned on. The graph shows that the initial temper-
ature of the water is close to room temperature. When the water from the hot water tank
reaches the faucet, the water's temperature T increases quickly. In the next phase, T is con-
stant at the temperature of the water in the tank. When the tank is drained, T decreases to
the temperature of the cold water supply.

! Definition of Function
We have previously used letters to A function is a rule. To talk about a function, we need to give it a name. We will use let-
stand for numbers. Here we do some- ters such as f, g, h, . . . to represent functions. For example, we can use the letter f to rep-
thing quite different: We use letters resent a rule as follows:
to represent rules.
"f " is the rule "square the number"
When we write f 122, we mean "apply the rule f to the number 2." Applying the rule gives
f 122 ! 22 ! 4. Similarly, f 132 ! 32 ! 9, f 142 ! 42 ! 16, and in general f 1x 2 ! x2.
DEFINITION OF A FUNCTION
A function f is a rule that assigns to each element x in a set A exactly one 
element, called f 1x 2, in a set B.
We usually consider functions for which the sets A and B are sets of real numbers. The

this function; that is, x is an independent variable. The symbol that represents a number in the range of f is callednot an accept-

cate an error. If x # 0, then an approxi-

connects an element of A to an element of B. The arrow indicates that f 1x 2 is associated

So f is the function

numbers.
The range of f consists of all possible outputs of f. Because x2 # 0 for all real

2 % 4 # 4, so for every output of f we have f 1x 2 # 4. Thus,
the range of f is 5y 0  y # 46 ! 34, q 2 .
