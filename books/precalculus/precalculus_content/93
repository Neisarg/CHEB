13.2 FINDING LIMITS ALGEBRAICALLY
Limit Laws ! Applying the Limit Laws ! Finding Limits Using Algebra and
the Limit Laws ! Using Left- and Right-Hand Limits
In Section 13.1 we used calculators and graphs to guess the values of limits, but we saw
that such methods don't always lead to the correct answer. In this section we use algebraic
methods to find limits exactly.
! Limit Laws
We use the following properties of limits, called the Limit Laws, to calculate limits.
LIMIT L AWS
Suppose that c is a constant and that the following limits exist:
lim f 1x 2  and  lim g1x 2
x!a x!a 
Then
1. lim 3f 1x 2 # g1x 2 4 $ lim f 1x 2 # lim g1x 2 Limit of a Sum
x!a
2. lim 3f 1x 2 x!a x!a " g1x 2 4 $ lim f 1x 2 " Limit of a Difference

These five laws can be stated verbally as follows:
Limit of a Sum 1. The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits.
Limit of a Difference 2. The limit of a difference is the difference of the limits.
Limit of a Constant Multiple 3. The limit of a constant times a function is the constant times the limit of the 
function.
Limit of a Product 4. The limit of a product is the product of the limits.
Limit of a Quotient 5. The limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits (provided that the limit of the
denominator is not 0).
g1 Ix 2t's easy to believe that these properties are true. Fof 1r x 2instan# 1ce f 1x 2x 2, if is close to L andis close to M, it is reasonable to conclude that is close to L # M. This
gives us an intuitive basis for believing that Law 1 is true.
If we use Law 4 (Limit of a Product) repeatedly with g1 gx 2 $ f 1x 2 , we obtain the fol-
lowing Law 6 for the limit of a power. A similar law holds for roots.

[If n is even, we assume that limx!a f 1x 2 ( 0.] 
In words, these laws say the following:
Limit of a Power 6. The limit of a power is the power of the limit.
Limit of a Root 7. The limit of a root is the root of the limit.

(b) We see that $ 2. But limxS1 g1x 2 does not exist because the 
left- and right-hand limits are different:
lim g1x 2 $ "2   lim g1x 2 $ "1
x!1" # x!1  
So we can't use Law 4 (Limit of a Product). The given limit does not exist, since
the left-hand limit is not equal to the right-hand limit.
(c) The graphs show that
lim f 1x 2 ! 1.4  and  lim g1x 2 $ 0
x!2 x!2  
Because the limit of the denominator is 0, we can't use Law 5 (Limit of a Quo-
tient). The given limit does not exist because the denominator approaches 0 while
the numerator approaches a nonzero number.
