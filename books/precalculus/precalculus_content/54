Solving Trigonometric Equations by Using Identities ! Equations 
with Trigonometric Functions of Multiples of Angles 
In this section we solve trigonometric equations by first using identities to simplify the
equation. We also solve trigonometric equations in which the terms contain multiples of
angles.
! Solving Trigonometric Equations by Using Identities
In the next two examples we use trigonometric identities to express a trigonometric equa-
tion in a form in which it can be factored.

Solve the equation 1 ! sin u " 2 cos2 u.
S O L U T I O N We first need to rewrite this equation so that it contains only one trigono-
metric function. To do this, we use a trigonometric identity:

Because sine has period 2p, we get all the solutions of the equation by adding integer
multiples of 2p to these solutions. Thus the solutions are
p 5p 3p

Both sine and cosine have period 2p, so we get all the solutions of the equation by adding
integer multiples of 2p to these solutions. Thus the solutions are 
p 3p p 5p
