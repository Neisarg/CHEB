In this section we find equations for straight lines lying in a coordinate plane. The equa-
tions will depend on how the line is inclined, so we begin by discussing the concept of
slope.
" The Slope of a Line
We first need a way to measure the "steepness" of a line, or how quickly it rises 
(or falls) as we move from left to right. We define run to be the distance we move to the
right and rise to be the corresponding distance that the line rises (or falls). The slope of a
line is the ratio of rise to run:
rise
slope "
run
Figure 1 shows situations in which slope is important. Carpenters use the term pitch for
the slope of a roof or a staircase; the term grade is used for the slope of a road.

If a line lies in a coordinate plane, then the run is the change in the x-coordinate and
the rise is the corresponding change in the y-coordinate between any two points on the
line (see Figure 2). This gives us the following definition of slope.

The slope of a vertical line is not defined.
The slope is independent of which two points are chosen on the line. We can see that
this is true from the similar triangles in Figure 3:

Figure 4 shows several lines labeled with their slopes. Notice that lines with positive
slope slant upward to the right, whereas lines with negative slope slant downward to the
right. The steepest lines are those for which the absolute value of the slope is the largest;
a horizontal line has slope zero.

y S O L U T I O N Since any two different points determine a line, only one line passes
Q(8, 5) through these two points. From the definition the slope is

This says that for every 3 units we move to the right, the line rises 2 units. The line is
P(2, 1) drawn in Figure 5.
