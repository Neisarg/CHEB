On these restricted domains we can define an inverse for each of these functions. By the
definition of inverse function we have 
sin#1 x " y 3  sin y " x
cos#1 x " y 3  cos y " x
tan#1 x " y 3  tan y " x
We summarize the domains and ranges of the inverse trigonometric functions in the
following box.
THE INVERSE SINE, INVERSE COSINE, AND INVERSE TANGENT FUNCTIONS
T3 he sine, cosine, and tangent functions on the restricted domains 0, p 4 1 3#p/2, p/2 4 ,, and #p/2, p/2 2 , respectively, are one-to one and so have inverses. The
inverse functions have domain and range as follows. 
Function Domain Range 
sin#1 3 3
cos#1 3#1, 1 4#1, 1 4 #p/2, p1 30, p 4
/2 4
tan#1 $ #p/2, p/2 2
The functions sin#1 cos#1, , and tan#1 are sometimes called arcsine, arccosine,
and arctangent, respectively. 
Since these are inverse functions, they reverse the rule of the original function. For ex-
ample, since sin p/6 " 12, it follows that sin#1 1 2 " p/6. The following example gives fur-
ther illustrations.
