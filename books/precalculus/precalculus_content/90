12.6 THE BINOMIAL THEOREM
Expanding (a# b)n ! The Binomial Coefficients ! The Binomial Theorem
! Proof of the Binomial Theorem
An expression of the form a # b is called a binomial. Although in principle it's easy to
raise a # b to any power, raising it to a very high power would be tedious. In this section
we find a formula that gives the expansion of 1a # b 2 n for any natural number n and then
prove it using mathematical induction.

The following simple patterns emerge for the expansion of 1a # b 2 n.
1. There are n # 1 terms, the first being an and the last being bn.
2. The exponents of a decrease by 1 from term to term, while the exponents of b in-
crease by 1.
3. The sum of the exponents of a and b in each term is n.
For instance, notice how the exponents of a and b behave in the expansion of 1a # b 2 5.
The expon1ents of a decrease:5 4 3 2 1a # b 2 5 ! a #  5a  b1 #   10a b2 #  10a b3 # 5a  b4 # b5
The expone1nts of b increase:a # b 2 5 1 2 3 ! a5 # 5a4b  #  10a3b  #  10a2b # 5a1b 4 5 
With these observations we can write the form of the expansion of 1 #  ba # b 2 n for any nat-
ural number n. For example, writing a question mark for the missing coefficients, we have
Óa # bÔ8 ! a8 # ? a7b # ? a6b2 # ? a5b3 # ? a4b4 # ? a3b5 # ? a2b6 # ? ab7 # b8
To complete the expansion, we need to determine these coefficients. To find a pattern, let's
write the coefficients in the expansion of 1a # b 2 n for the first few values of n in a trian-
gular array as show1n in the following array, which is called Pascal's triangle.a # b 2

From this property it is easy to find any row of Pascal's triangle from the row above it.
What we now call Pascal's triangle For instance, we find the sixth and seventh rows, starting with the fifth row:

a # b 2 6 ! a6 # 6a51b # 15a4b2 # 20a3b3 #  15a2b4 # 6ab5 # b6We arrive at the expansion a # b 2 6 of by multiply1 ing 1a # b 2 5 by a # b 2 1a # b 2 . Notice, forinstance, that the circled term in the expansion of 6 is obtained via this multipli-
cation from the two circled terms above it. We get this term when the two terms above it
are multiplied by b and a, respectively. Thus its coefficient is the sum of the coefficients
of these two terms. We will use this observation at the end of this section when we prove
the Binomial Theorem.
Having found these patterns, we can now easily obtain the expansion of any binomial,
at least to relatively small powers.
