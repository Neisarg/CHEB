4.4 LAWS OF LOGARITHMS
Laws of Logarithms ! Expanding and Combining Logarithmic Expressions
! Change of Base Formula
In this section we study properties of logarithms. These properties give logarithmic func-
tions a wide range of applications, as we will see in Section 4.6.
! Laws of Logarithms
Since logarithms are exponents, the Laws of Exponents give rise to the Laws of
Logarithms.
L AWS OF LOGARITHMS
Let a be a positive number, with a # 1. Let A, B, and C be any real numbers with A " 0 and B " 0.
Law Description
1. loga1AB 2 ! loga A & l
A
loga a b oga B The logarithm of a product of numbers is the sum of the logarithms of the numbers.2. gB a A $ loga B The logarithm of a quotient of numbers is the difference of the logarithms of the
numbers.
3. loga1
! l
AC 2 o! C loga A The logarithm of a power of a number is the exponent times the logarithm of the number.
P R O O F We make use of the property logaax ! x from Section 4.3.
Law 1 Let loga A ! u and loga B ! √. When written in exponential form, these equa-
tions become
au ! A  and √  a ! B
Thus u loga1AB 2 ! loga1a a√ 2 ! loga1au&√ 2
 ! u & √ ! loga A & loga B
Law 2 Using Law 1, we have
A
loga A ! loga c a b B d A! log a b & l gB a o  BB a
A
so loga a b ! logB a A $ loga B
Law 3 Let loga A ! u. Then au ! A, so
log Ca1A 2 ! log Ca1au 2 ! loga1auC 2 ! uC ! C loga A "
