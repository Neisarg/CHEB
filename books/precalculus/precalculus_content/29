In this chapter we study a new class of functions called exponential functions. For example,
f 1x 2 ! 2x
is an exponential function (with base 2). Notice how quickly the values of this function
increase:
 f 13 2 ! 23 ! 8
 f 110 2 ! 210 !
 f 130 2 1024
g1 !x 2 230 ! 1,073,741,824Compare this with the function ! x2, where g130 2 ! 302 ! 900. The point is that
when the variable is in the exponent, even a small change in the variable can cause a dra-
matic change in the value of the function.
! Exponential Functions
To study exponential functions, we must first define what we mean by the exponential ex-
pression ax when x is any real number. In Section 1.2 we defined ax for a " 0 and x a ra-
tional number, but we have not yet defined irrational powers. So what is meant by 513 or
2p? To define ax when x is irrational, we approximate x by rational numbers.
For example, since 13 ! 1.73205. . .
is an irrational number, we successively approximate a13 by the following rational powers:
a1.7 1, a .73, a1.732, a1.7320, a1.73205, . . .
Intuitively, we can see that these rational powers of a are getting closer and closer to 
a1
a13. It
can be shown by using advanced mathematics that there is exactly one number that these
powers approach. We define 3 to be this number.
For example, using a calculator, w
2
 51e find3 ! 51.73
 2411. . .
51 1 ! 16.The more decimal places of 3 we use in our calculation, the better our approximation of 3.
The Laws of Exponents are listed on It can be proved that the Laws of Exponents are still true when the exponents are real

EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
The exponential function with base a is defined for all real numbers x by
f 1x 2 ! ax
where a " 0 and a # 1.
We assume that a # 1 because the function f1x 2 ! 1x ! 1 is just a constant function.
Here are some examples
