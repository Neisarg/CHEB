Many problems in the sciences, economics, finance, medicine, and numerous other fields
can be translated into algebra problems; this is one reason that algebra is so useful. In this
section we use equations as mathematical models to solve real-life problems.
! Making and Using Models
We will use the following guidelines to help us set up equations that model situations de-
scribed in words. To show how the guidelines can help you to set up equations, we note
them as we work each example in this section.
GUIDELINES FOR MODELING WITH EQUATIONS
1. Identify the Variable. Identify the quantity that the problem asks you to find.
This quantity can usually be determined by a careful reading of the question
that is posed at the end of the problem. Then introduce notation for the vari-
able (call it x or some other letter).
2. Translate from Words to Algebra. Read each sentence in the problem again,
and express all the quantities mentioned in the problem in terms of the variable
you defined in Step 1. To organize this information, it is sometimes helpful to
draw a diagram or make a table.
3. Set Up the Model. Find the crucial fact in the problem that gives a relation-
ship between the expressions you listed in Step 2. Set up an equation (or
model) that expresses this relationship.
4. Solve the Equation and Check Your Answer. Solve the equation, check your an-
swer, and express it as a sentence that answers the question posed in the problem.

The following example illustrates how these guidelines are used to translate a "word
problem" into the language of algebra.
E X A M P L E  1 | Renting a Car
A car rental company charges $30 a day and 15¢ a mile for renting a car. Helen rents a
car for two days, and her bill comes to $108. How many miles did she drive?
S O L U T I O N
Identify the variable. We are asked to find the number of miles Helen has driven. So
we let
x ! number of miles driven
Translate from words to algebra. Now we translate all the information given in the
problem into the language of algebra.
In Words In Algebra
Number of miles driven x
Mileage cost (at $0.15 per mile) 0.15x
Daily cost (at $30 per day) 21302
Set up the model. Now we set up the model.
mileage cost % daily cost total cost
0.15x % 2130 2 !! 108
Solve. Now we solve for x.
 0.15x ! 48 Subtract 60
48
C H E C K  Y O U R  A N S W E R  x ! Divide by 0.15
total cost ! mileage cost % daily cost
 ! 0.151320 2 % 2130 2 0.15 x ! 320 Calculator
 ! 108 # Helen drove her rental car 320 miles.
