6.5 THE LAW OF SINES
The Law of Sines ! The Ambiguous Case
C In Section 6.2 we used the trigonometric ratios to solve right triangles. The trigonometric
functions can also be used to solve oblique triangles, that is, triangles with no right an-
gles. To do this, we first study the Law of Sines here and then the Law of Cosines in the
b a next section. To state these laws (or formulas) more easily, we follow the convention of
labeling the angles of a triangle as A, B, C and the lengths of the corresponding opposite
sides as a, b, c, as in Figure 1.
A c B
To solve a triangle, we need to know certain information about its sides and angles. To
decide whether we have enough information, it's often helpful to make a sketch. For in-
stance, if we are given two angles and the included side, then it's clear that one and only
F I G U R E  1
one triangle can be formed (see Figure 2(a)). Similarly, if two sides and the included an-
gle are known, then a unique triangle is determined (Figure 2(c)). But if we know all three
angles and no sides, we cannot uniquely determine the triangle because many triangles
can have the same three angles. (All these triangles would be similar, of course.) So we
won't consider this last case.

In general, a triangle is determined by three of its six parts (angles and sides) as long as at
least one of these three parts is a side. So the possibilities, illustrated in Figure 2, are as follows.
Case 1 One side and two angles (ASA or SAA)
Case 2 Two sides and the angle opposite one of those sides (SSA)
Case 3 Two sides and the included angle (SAS)
Case 4 Three sides (SSS)
Cases 1 and 2 are solved by using the Law of Sines; Cases 3 and 4 require the Law of Cosines.
! The Law of Sines
The Law of Sines says that in any triangle the lengths of the sides are proportional to the
sines of the corresponding opposite angles.

called the ambiguous case. To see why this is so, we show in Figure 6 the possibilities
when angle A and sides a and b are given. In part (a) no solution is possible, since side a
is too short to complete the triangle. In part (b) the solution is a right triangle. In part (c)
two solutions are possible, and in part (d) there is a unique triangle with the given prop-
erties. We illustrate the possibilities of Case 2 in the following examples.
