cos1s ! t 2 " cos s cos t # sin s sin t, we use Figure 1. In the figure, the distances 
P⁄ s s+t t, s ! t, and #s have been marked on the unit circle, starting at P011, 0 2 and terminating
at Q1, P1, and Q0, respectively. The coordinates of these points areQ⁄

Since cos1#s 2  P11cos1O P‚ x 1 " cos s and , it follows that the point Q0 has the coor-dinates cos s, #sin s 2 sin1#s 2 " #sin s_s Q0 . Notice that the distances between P0 and P1 and between Q0
and Q1 measured along the arc of the circle are equal. Since equal arcs are subtended by
Q‚ equal chords, it follows that . Using the Distance Formula, we get
