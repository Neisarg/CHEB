11.5 ROTATION OF AXES
Rotation of Axes ! General Equation of a Conic ! The Discriminant
In Section 11.4 we studied conics with equations of the form
Ax2 ! Cy2 ! Dx ! Ey ! F " 0
We saw that the graph is always an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola with horizontal or ver-
tical axes (except in the degenerate cases). In this section we study the most general 
second-degree equation
Ax2 ! Bxy ! Cy2 ! Dx ! Ey ! F " 0

y We will see that the graph of an equation of this form is also a conic. In fact, by rotating
Y P(x, y) the coordinate axes through an appropriate angle, we can eliminate the term Bxy and then
P(X, Y) use our knowledge of conic sections to analyze the graph.
X ! Rotation of Axes
In Figure 1 the x- and y-axes have been rotated through an acute angle f about the origin
ƒ to produce a new pair of axes, which we call the X- a
0 x 1x, y 2 1X, Y 2nd Y-axes. A point P that has coor-dinates in the old system has coordinates in the new system. If we let r de-
note the distance of P from the origin and let u be the angle that the segment OP makes
with the new X-axis, then we can see from Figure 2 (by considering the two right trian-
F I G U R E  1 gles in the figure) that
y X " r cos u      Y " r sin u
Y
 x " r cos1u ! f 2   y " r sin1u ! f 2
P
Using the Addition Formula for Cosine, we see that
Y
r Xy  x " r cos1u ! f 2
¨  " r 1cos u cos f # sin u sin f 2
ƒ X
 " 1r cos u 2  cos f # 1r sin u 2  sin f
0 x x
 " X cos f # Y sin f
Similarly, we can apply the Addition Formula for Sine to the expression for y to obtain 
F I G U R E  2 y " X sin f! Y cos f. By treating these equations for x and y as a system of linear equa-
tions in the variables X and Y (see Exercise 35), we obtain expressions for X and Y in terms
of x and y, as detailed in the following box.

S1 uppx, y 2ose the x- and y-axes in a coordinate plane are rotated through the acute an-gle f to produce the X- and Y-axes, as shown in Figure 1. Then the coordinatesand 1X, Y 2 of a point in the xy- and the XY-planes are related as follows:
 x " X cos f # Y sin f     X " x cos f ! y sin f
 y " X sin f ! Y cos f     Y " #x sin f ! y cos f
