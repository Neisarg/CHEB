7.3 DOUBLE-ANGLE, HALF-ANGLE, AND PRODUCT-SUM FORMULAS
Double-Angle Formulas ! Half-Angle Formulas ! Simplifying Expressions
Involving Inverse Trigonometric Functions ! Product-Sum Formulas
The identities we consider in this section are consequences of the addition formulas. The
Double-Angle Formulas allow us to find the values of the trigonometric functions at 2x
from their values at x. The Half-Angle Formulas relate the values of the trigonometric
functions at 12 x to their values at x. The Product-Sum Formulas relate products of sines
and cosines to sums of sines and cosines.

! Double-Angle Formulas
The formulas in the following box are immediate consequences of the addition formulas,
which we proved in the preceding section.
DOUBLE-ANGLE FORMUL AS
Formula for sine:  sin 2x " 2 sin x cos x
Formulas for cosine: cos 2x " cos2 x # sin2 x
 " 1 # 2 sin2 x
 " 2 cos2 x # 1
2 tan x
Formula for tangent: tan 2x "
1 # tan2 x
The proofs for the formulas for cosine are given here. You are asked to prove the re-
maining formulas in Exercises 35 and 36.

 cos 2x " cos1x ! x 2
 " cos x cos x # sin x sin x
 " cos2 x # sin2 x
The second and third formulas for cos 2x are obtained from the formula we just proved
and the Pythagorean identity. Substituting cos2x " 1 # sin2x gives
 cos 2x " cos2 
 " 1 x # sin2 x1 # sin2 x 2 # sin2 x
 " 1 # 2 sin2x
The third formula is obtained in the same way, by substituting sin2x " 1 # cos2x. "
E X A M P L E  1 Using the Double-Angle Formulas
If cos x " # 2 3 and x is in Quadrant II, find cos 2x and sin 2x.
S O L U T I O N Using one of the Double-Angle Formulas for Cosine, we get
 cos 2x " 2 cos2 x # 1
2 2 8 1
 " 2 a# b # 1 " # 1 " #

To use the formula sin 2x " 2 sin x cos x, we n
sin x " 21 # cos2 x " 2eed to 51 # Afind#23B sin x2 1first. We have" 3
where we have used the positive square root because sin x is positive in Quadrant II.
Thus
 sin 2x " 2 sin x cos x
