! Geometric Definition of a Parabola
We saw in Section 3.1 that the graph of the equation
y " ax 2 ! bx ! c
is a U-shaped curve called a parabola that opens either upward or downward, depending
on whether the sign of a is positive or negative.
In this section we study parabolas from a geometric rather than an algebraic point of
view. We begin with the geometric definition of a parabola and show how this leads to the
algebraic formula that we are already familiar with.
GEOMETRIC DEFINITION OF A PARABOL A
A parabola is the set of points in the plane that are equidistant from a fixed point
F (called the focus) and a fixed line l (called the directrix).
This definition is illustrated in Figure 1. The vertex V of the parabola lies halfway be-
tween the focus and the directrix, and the axis of symmetry is the line that runs through
the focus perpendicular to the directrix.

In this section we restrict our attention to parabolas that are situated with the vertex 
y at the origin and that have 
P(x, y)
0, p 2a vertical or horizontal axis of symmetry. (Parabolas in moregeneral positions will be considered in Sections 11.4 and 11.5.) If the focus of such aparabola is the point , then the axis of symmetry must be vertical, and the directrix
has the equa

By the definition of a parabola these two distances must be equal:

 x 2 ! 11y # p 2 2 " 0 y ! p 0y # p 2 2 " 0 y ! p 0 2 " 1y ! p 2 2 Square both sides

If p $ 0, then the parabola opens upward; but if p % 0, it opens downward. When x is re-
placed by #x, the equation remains unchanged, so the graph is symmetric about the y-axis.

of a parabola with a vertical axis.
