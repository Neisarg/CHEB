4.6 MODELING WITH EXPONENTIAL AND LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS
Exponential Growth (Doubling Time) ! Exponential Growth (Relative 
Growth Rate) ! Radioactive Decay ! Newton's Law of Cooling !
Logarithmic Scales
Many processes that occur in nature, such as population growth, radioactive decay, heat
diffusion, and numerous others, can be modeled by using exponential functions. Loga-
rithmic functions are used in models for the loudness of sounds, the intensity of earth-
quakes, and many other phenomena. In this section we study exponential and logarithmic
models.
! Exponential Growth (Doubling Time)
Suppose we start with a single bacterium, which divides every hour. After one hour we
have 2 bacteria, 2 3
f 1 at 2fter two hours we have 2 or 4 bacteria, after three hours we have 2 or8 bacteria, and so on (see Figure 1). We see that we can model the bacteria population af-ter t hours by ! 2t.

If we start with 10 of these bacteria, then the population is modeled by f 1t 2 ! 10 # 2t.
A slower-growing strain of bacteria doubles every 3 hours; in this case the population is
modeled by f 1t 2 ! 10 # 2t/3. In general, we have the following.
EXPONENTIAL GROW TH (DOUBLING TIME)
If the intial size of a population is n 0 and the doubling time is a, then the size of
the population at time t is 
n1t 2 ! n 02t/a
where a and t are measured in the same time units (minutes, hours, days, years,
and so on).

Under ideal conditions a certain bacteria population doubles every three hours. Initially
there are 1000 bacteria in a colony.
