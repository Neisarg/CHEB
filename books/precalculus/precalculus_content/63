9.3 THREE-DIMENSIONAL COORDINATE GEOMETRY
The Three-Dimensional Rectangular Coordinate System ! Distance Formula
in Three Dimensions ! The Equation of a Sphere 
To locate a point in a plane, two numbers are necessary. We know that any point in the
Cartesian plane can be represented as an ordered pair 1a, b2 of real numbers, where a is
the x-coordinate and b is the y-coordinate. In three-dimensional space, a third dimension
is added, so any point in space is represented by an ordered triple 1a, b, c2 of real 
numbers.

z To represent points in space, we first choose a fixed point O (the origin) and three directedlines through O that are perpendicular to each other, called the coordinate axes and labeled
the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis. Usually we think of the x- and y-axes as being horizontal and
the z-axis as being vertical, and we draw the orientation of the axes as in Figure 1. 
The three coordinate axes determine the three coordinate planes illustrated in Figure
O 2(a). The xy-plane is the plane that contains the x- and y-axes; the yz-plane is the plane
that contains the y- and z-axes; the xz-plane is the plane that contains the x- and z-axes.
y These three coordinate planes divide space into eight parts, called octants.

Because people often have difficulty visualizing diagrams of three-dimensional figures, you
may find it helpful to do the following (see Figure 2(b)). Look at any bottom corner of a room
and call the corner the origin. The wall on your left is in the xz-plane, the wall on your right is
z in the yz-plane, and the floor is in the xy-plane. The x-axis runs along the intersection of thefloor and the left wall; the y-axis runs along the intersection of the floor and the right wall. The
P(a, b, c) z1-axis rua, b, c 2 ns up from the floor toward the ceiling along the intersection of the two walls.Now any point P in space can be located by a unique ordered triple of real numbers, as shown in Figure 3. The first number a is the x-coordinate of P, the second

a O number b is the y-coordinate of P, and the third number c is the z-coordinate of P. The set
of all ordered triples 5 1x, y, z 2  0  x, y, z ! "6 forms the three-dimensional rectangular co-
