9VECTORS IN TWO AND THREE DIMENSIONS
9.1 Vectors in Two Dimensions Many real-world quantities are described mathematically by just one number:
their "size" or magnitude. For example, quantities such as mass, volume,
9.2 The Dot Product distance, and temperature are described by their magnitude. But many other
9.3 Three-Dimensional Coordinate real-world quantities involve both magnitude and direction. Such quantities are
Geometry described mathematically by vectors. For example, if you push a car with a
certain force, the direction in which you push on the car is important; you get
9.4 Vectors in Three Dimensions different results if you push the car forward, backward, or perhaps sideways.
9.5 The Cross Product So force is a vector. The result of several forces acting on an object can be
evaluated by using vectors. For example, we'll see how we can combine the
9.6 Equations of Lines and Planes
vector forces of wind and water on the sails and hull of a sailboat to find the
FOCUS ON MODELING direction in which the boat will sail. Analyzing these vector forces helps
Vector Fields sailors to sail against the wind by tacking. (See the Discovery Project Sailing
Against the Wind referenced on page 597.)
