9.1 VECTORS IN TWO DIMENSIONS
Geometric Description of Vectors ! Vectors in the Coordinate Plane
! Using Vectors to Model Velocity and Force
In applications of mathematics, certain quantities are determined completely by their
magnitude-for example, length, mass, area, temperature, and energy. We speak of a
length of 5 m or a mass of 3 kg; only one number is needed to describe each of these quan-
tities. Such a quantity is called a scalar.
On the other hand, to describe the displacement of an object, two numbers are re-
quired: the magnitude and the direction of the displacement. To describe the velocity of a
moving object, we must specify both the speed and the direction of travel. Quantities such
B as displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force that involve magnitude as well as direc-
tion are called directed quantities. One way to represent such quantities mathematically
u=AB is through the use of vectors.

! Geometric Description of Vectors
F I G U R E  1
A vector in the plane is a line segment with an assigned direction. We sketch a vector a!s
shown in Figure 1 with an arrow to specify the direction. We denote this! vector by AB .
P0 oint AB! !AB 0 A is the initial point, and B is the terminal point of the vector . The length ofthe line segment AB is called the magnitude or length of the vector and is denoted by. We use boldface letters to denote vectors. Thus we write u $ AB .
Two vectors are considered equal if they have equal magnitude and the same direction.
Thus all the vectors in Figure 2 are equal. This definition of equality makes sense if we
think of a vector as representing a displacement. Two such displacements are the same if
F I G U R E  2 they have equal magnitudes and the same direction. So the vectors in Figure 2 can be
thought of as the same displace!ment applied to objects in different locati!ons in the plane.
C If the displacement !u $ AB is followed by the displacement v $ BC , then the result-
ing displacement is AC as! shown in Figure 3. In other words, the single displacement rep-
AC=AB+BC resented by the vec!tor AC has the same effect aBC !
s the othe! r two displacemen!ts toget!her. W!e
call the vector AC the sum of the vectors AB and BC , and we write AC $ AB ! BC .
(The zero vector, denoted by 0, represents no displacement.) Thus to find the sum of any
two vectors u and v, we sketch vectors equal to u and v with the initial point of one at the
A BAB terminal point of the other (see Figure 4(a)). If we draw u and v starting at the same point,
then u ! v is the vector that is the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by u and v shown
F I G U R E  3 in Figure 4(b).

If a is a real numbe0r ana 0 d 0  vv 0 is a vector, we define a new vector av as follows: The vec-tor av has magnitude and has the same direction as v if a " 0 and the opposite
direction if a # 0. If a $ 0, then av $ 0, the zero vector. This process is called multipli-
cation of a vector by a1  sca%1 2lar. Multiplying a vector by a scalar has the effect of stretch-ing or shrinking the vector. Figure 5 shows graphs of the vector av for different values ofa. We write the vector v as %v. Thus %v is the vector with the same length as v but
with the opposite direction.

! Vectors in the Coordinate Plane
So far, we've discussed vectors geometrically. By placing a vector in a coordinate plane,
we can describe it analytically (that is, by using components). In Figure 7(a), to go from
the initial point of the vector v to the terminal point, we move a units to the right and b
units upward. We represent v as an ordered pair o

where a is the horizontal component of v and b is the vertical component of v. Re-
member that a vector represents a magnitude and a direction, not a particular arrow in the
plane. Thus the vector !a, b" has many different representations, depending on its initial
point (see Figure 7(b)).
