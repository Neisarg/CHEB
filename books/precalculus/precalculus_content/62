9.2 THE DOT PRODUCT
The Dot Product of Vectors ! The Component of u Along v ! The Projection
of u Onto v ! Work
In this section we define an operation on vectors called the dot product. This concept is es-
pecially useful in calculus and in applications of vectors to physics and engineering.
! The Dot Product of Vectors
We begin by defining the dot product of two vectors.

DEFINITION OF THE DOT PRODUCT
If u $ !a1, b1" and v $ !a2, b2" are vectors, then their dot product, denoted by 
u (v, is defined by
u # v $ a1a2 ! b1b2
Thus to find the dot product of u and v, we multiply corresponding components and add.
The dot product is not a vector; it is a real number, or scalar.
