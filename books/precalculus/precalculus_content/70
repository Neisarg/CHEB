A matrix is simply a rectangular array of numbers. Matrices* are used to organize informa-
tion into categories that correspond to the rows and columns of the matrix. For example, a
scientist might organize information on a population of endangered whales as follows:
Immature Juvenile Adult
Male B12     52     18R
Female 15     42     11
This is a compact way of saying that there are 12 immature males, 15 immature females,
18 adult males, and so on.
In this section we represent a linear system by a matrix, called the augmented matrix
of the system:
Lbinear system Augmented matrix2x #   y ! 5 Equation 1 B2 #1 5R
  x " 4y ! 7 Equation 2 1 4 7
x y
The augmented matrix contains the same information as the system, but in a simpler form.
The operations we learned for solving systems of equations can now be performed on the
augmented matrix.
! Matrices
We begin by defining the various elements that make up a matrix.
DEFINITION OF MATRIX
An m $ n matrixEis a rectangular array of numbers with m rows and n columns.a p11 a12 a13 a1n da21 a22 a p23 a2 dna31 a32 a p33 a3nU d
 m rows o o o ∞ o
a pm1 am2 am3 amn d
c c c c 
n columns
We say that the matrix has dimension m $ n. The numbers aij are the entries of
the matrix. The subscript on the entry aij indicates that it is in the ith row and the
jth column.
*The plural of matrix is matrices.

! The Augmented Matrix of a Linear System
We can write a system of linear equations as a matrix, called the augmented matrix of
the system, by cwriting only the coefficients and constants that appear in the equations.Here is an example.Linear system Augmented matrix  3x # 2y " z !   5   C 3 #2 1 5 x " 3y # z !   0 1 3 #1 0S
#x "      4z ! 11 #1 0 4 11
Notice that a missing variable in an equation corresponds to a 0 entry in the augmented
matrix.
