8.3 POLAR FORM OF COMPLEX NUMBERS; DE MOIVRE'S THEOREM
Graphing Complex Numbers ! Polar Form of Complex Numbers !
De Moivre's Theorem ! nth Roots of Complex Numbers
In this section we represent complex numbers in polar (or trigonometric) form. This en-
ables us to find the nth roots of complex numbers. To describe the polar form of complex
Imaginary numbers, we must first learn to work with complex numbers graphically.

To graph real numbers or sets of real numbers, we have been using the number line, which
0 a has just one dimension. Complex numbers, however, have two components: a real partReal
axis and an imaginary part. This suggests that we need two axes to graph complex numbers:
one for the real part and one for the imaginary part. We call these the real axis and the
F I G U R E  1 i1maga,  b 2inary axis, respectively. The plane determined by these two axes is called the com-plex plane. To graph the complex number a ! bi, we plot the ordered pair of numbersin this plane, as indicated in Figure 1.

Im Recall that the absolute value of a real number can be thought of as its distance from
the origin on the real number line (see Section 1.1). We define absolute value for complex
bi a+bi numbers in a similar fashion. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can see from Figure 4
that the distance between a ! bi and the origin in the complex plane is 2a 2 2œ∑a∑™+∑∑∑b∑™  ! b . Thisleads to the following definition.
