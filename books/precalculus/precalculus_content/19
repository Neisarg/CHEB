2.7 ONE-TO-ONE FUNCTIONS AND THEIR INVERSES
One-to-One Functions ! The Inverse of a Function ! Graphing the Inverse 
of a Function
The inverse of a function is a rule that acts on the output of the function and produces the
corresponding input. So the inverse "undoes" or reverses what the function has done. Not
all functions have inverses; those that do are called one-to-one.
! One-to-One Functions
Let's compare the functions f and g whose arrow diagrams are shown in Figure 1. Note
that f never

property are called one-to-one.

Is the function f 1x 2 ! x3 one-to-one?

f 1x 2 ! x3 more than once. Therefore, by the Horizontal Line Test, f is one-to-one.
