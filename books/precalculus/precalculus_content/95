13.4 LIMITS AT INFINIT Y; LIMITS OF SEQUENCES
Limits at Infinity ! Limits of Sequences
In this section we st
f 1udx 2y a special kind of limit called a limit at infinity. We examine thelimit of a function as x becomes large. We also examine the limit of a sequence an as
n becomes large. Limits of sequences will be used in Section 13.5 to help us find the area
under the graph of a function.

As x grows larger and larger, you can see that the v
f 1alues of fx 2 1x 2 get closer and closerto 1. In fact, it seems that we can make the values of as close as we like to 1 by tak-
ing x sufficiently large. This situation is expressed symbolically by writing
x2 " 1
lim  $ 1
xSq x2 # 1
In general, we use the notation
f 1 lx 2 im  f 1x 2 $ LxSqto indicate that the values of become closer and closer to L as x becomes larger and
larger.
LIMIT AT INFINIT Y
Let f be a function defined on some interval 1a,  q 2 . Then
f 1x 2 lim  f 1x 2 $ LxSqmeans that the values of can be made arbitrarily close to L by taking x
sufficiently large.
Another notation for lim  f 1x 2 $ L is
xSq
Limits at infinity are also discussed in

graph of f to approach the line y $ L (which is called a horizontal asymptote) as we look

we can make f 1x 2 as close as we like to 1. This is expressed by writing

It follows that the line y $ 0 (the x-axis) is a horizontal asymptote of the curve y $ 1/x.
(This is a hyperbola; see Figure 5.)
