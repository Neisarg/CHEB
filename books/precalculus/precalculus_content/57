The graph of a polar equation consists of all points P that have at least one po-
lar representation 1r,  u 2 r % f 1u 2whose coordinates satisfy the equation. Many curves that arise in
mathematics and its applications are more easily and naturally represented by polar equa-
tions than by rectangular equations.

A rectangular grid is helpful for plotting points in rectangular coordinates (see Figure
1(a)). To plot points in polar coordinates, it is convenient to use a grid consisting of cir-
cles centered at the pole and rays emanating from the pole, as in Figure 1(b). We will use
such grids to help us sketch polar graphs.
