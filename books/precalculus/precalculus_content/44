ered the founder of trigonometry. He
constructed tables for a function closely
related to the modern sine function and
evaluated for angles at half-degree in-
tervals.These are considered the first
trigonometric tables. He used his tables 50
mainly to calculate the paths of the 30
planets through the heavens.
