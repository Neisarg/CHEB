SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES
10.1 Systems of Linear Equations Throughout the preceding chapters we modeled real-world situations by 
in Two Variables equations. But many real-world situations involve too many variables to be
modeled by a single equation. For example, weather depends on the 
10.2 Systems of Linear Equations 
relationship among many variables, including temperature, wind speed, air
in Several Variables pressure, and humidity. So to model (and forecast) the weather, scientists use
10.3 Matrices and Systems many equations, each having many variables. Such collections of equations,
of Linear Equations called systems of equations, work together to describe the weather. Systems 
of equations with hundreds of variables are used by airlines to establish 
10.4 The Algebra of Matrices
consistent flight schedules and by telecommunications companies to find 
10.5 Inverses of Matrices and efficient routings for telephone calls. In this chapter we learn how to solve 
Matrix Equations systems of equations that consist of several equations in several variables. 
10.6 Determinants and Cramer's
Rule
10.7 Partial Fractions
10.8 Systems of Nonlinear
Equations
10.9 Systems of Inequalities
