Graphs of Tangent, Cotangent, Secant, and Cosecant ! Graphs of Transforma-
tions of Tangent and Cotangent ! Graphs of Transformations of Cosecant 
and Secant
In this section we graph the tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions and trans-
formations of these functions.
! Graphs of Tangent, Cotangent, Secant, and Cosecant
We begin by stating the periodic properties of these functions. Recall that sine and cosine
have period 2p. Since cosecant and secant are the reciprocals of sine and cosine, respec-
tively, they also have period 2p (see Exercise 55). Tangent and cotangent, however, have
period p (see Exercise 85 of Section 5.2).
PERIODIC PROPERTIES
The functions tangent and cotangent have period p:
tan1x ! p 2 " tan x   cot1x ! p 2 " cot x
The functions cosecant and secant have period 2p:
csc1x ! 2p 2 " csc x   sec1x ! 2p 2 " sec x
x tan x We first sketch the graph of tangent. Since it has period p, we need only sketch the
graph on any interval of length p and then repeat the pattern to the left and to the right.
0 0 We sketch the graph on the interval 1#p/2, p/2 2 . Since tan1p/22 and tan1#p/2 2 aren't
'/6 0.58 defined, we need to be careful in sketching the graph at points near p/2 and #p/2. 
'/4 1.00 As x gets near p/2 through values less than p/2, the value of tan x becomes large. To see

1.4 5.80 this, notice that as x gets close to p/2, cos x approaches 0 and sin x approaches 1 and so
tan x " sin x/cos x is large. A table of values of tan x for x close to p/2 1!1.570796 2 is

shown in the margin.
1.55 48.08 Thus, by choosing x close enough to p/2 through values less than p/2, we can make
1.57 1,255.77 the value of tan x larger than any given positive number. We express this by writing
1.5707 10,381.33
p#
tan x!q  as  x!

This is read "tan x approaches infinity as x approaches p/2 from the left."
In a similar way, by choosing x close to #p/2 through values greater than #p/2, we
can make tan x smaller than any given negative number. We write this as
p!
Arrow notation is discussed in tan x!#q  as  x!# 
Section 3.7. 2
This is read "tan x approaches negative infinity as x approaches #p/2 from the right."
Asymptotes are discussed in Thus, the graph of y" tan x approaches the vertical lines x"p/2 and x"#p/2. So these
Section 3.7. lines are vertical asymptotes. With the information we have so far, we sketch the graph of

_pi the origin, whereas that of y " sec x is symmetric about the y-axis. This is because tan-
gent, cotangent, and cosecant are odd functions, whereas secant is an even function.
