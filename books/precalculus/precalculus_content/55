8POLAR COORDINATES AND PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS
8.1 Polar Coordinates In Section 1.8 we learned how to graph points in rectangular coordinates. In
this chapter we study a different way of locating points in the plane, called po-

same location "as the crow flies"; we can say that it's 1.5 miles northeast of

The Path of a Projectile coordinates the location of a point is given by an ordered pair of numbers: the
distance of the point from the origin (or pole) and the angle from the positive
x-axis. 
Why do we study different coordinate systems? It's because certain curves
are more naturally described in one coordinate system rather than another. For
example, in rectangular coordinates lines and parabolas have simple equations,
but equations of circles are rather complicated. We'll see that in polar coordi-
nates circles have very simple equations.
