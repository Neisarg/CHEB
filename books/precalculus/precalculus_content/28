4EXPONENTIAL AND LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS
4.1 Exponential Functions In this chapter we study a class of functions called exponential functions.
4.2 The Natural Exponential These are functions, like f 1x 2 ! 2x, where the independent variable is in the
Function exponent. Exponential functions are used in modeling many real-world phe-
nomena, such as the growth of a population or the growth of an investment
4.3 Logarithmic Functions that earns compound interest. Once an exponential model is obtained, we can
4.4 Laws of Logarithms use the model to predict population size or calculate the amount of an invest-
ment for any future date. To find out when a population will reach a certain
4.5 Exponential and Logarithmic level, we use the inverse functions of exponential functions, called logarithmic
Equations functions. So if we have an exponential model for population growth, we can
4.6 Modeling with Exponential answer questions like: When will my city be as crowded as the New York City
and Logarithmic Functions street pictured above?
