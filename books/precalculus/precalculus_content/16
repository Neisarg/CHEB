2.4 AVERAGE RATE OF CHANGE OF A FUNCTION
Average Rate of Change ! Linear Functions Have Constant Rate of Change
Functions are often used to model changing quantities. In this section we learn how to find
the rate at which the values of a function change as the input variable changes.
! Average Rate of Change
We are all familiar with the concept of speed: If you drive a distance of 120 miles in 
2 hours, then your average speed, or rate of travel, is 120 mi2 h ! 60 mi/h. Now suppose you
take a car trip and record the distance that you travel every few minutes. The distance s
you have traveled is a function of the time t:
s 1t 2 ! total distance traveled at time t
We graph the function s as shown in Figure 1. The graph shows that you have traveled a
total of 50 miles after 1 hour, 75 miles after 2 hours, 140 miles after 3 hours, and so on.
To find your average speed between any two points on the trip, we divide the distance
traveled by the time elapsed.
s (mi)

Let's calculate your average speed between 1:00 P.M. and 4:00 P.M. The time elapsed is
4 $ 1 ! 3 hours. To find the distance you traveled, we subtract the distance at 1:00 P.M.
from the distance at 4:00 P.M., that is, 200 $ 50 ! 150 mi. Thus, your average speed is

Finding average rates of change is important in many contexts. For instance, we 
might be interested in knowing how quickly the air temperature is dropping as a storm
approaches or how fast revenues are increasing from the sale of a new product. So we 
need to know how to determine the average rate of change of the functions that model 
these quantities. In fact, the concept of average rate of change can be defined for any
function.

The average rate of change of the function y ! f 1x 2 between x ! a and x ! b is

The average rate of change is the slope of the secant line between x ! a and 
x ! b on the graph of f, that is, the line that passes through 1a, f 1a 22  and 1b, f 1b 22 .
