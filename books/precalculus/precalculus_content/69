10.2 SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN SEVERAL VARIABLES
Solving a Linear System ! The Number of Solutions of a Linear System !
Modeling Using Linear Systems
A linear equation in n variables is an equation that can be put in the form
a1x1 " a2x2 " p " anxn ! c
where a1, a2, . . . , an and c are real numbers, and x 1, x 2, . . . , x n are the variables. If we
have only three or four variables, we generally use x, y, z, and „ instead of x 1, x 2, x 3, and 
x 4. Such equations are called linear because if we have just two variables, the equation is
a1x " a2y ! c, which is the equation of a line. Here are some examples of equations in
three variables that illustrate the difference between linear and nonlinear equations.

The following are two examples of systems of linear equations in three variables. The sec-
ond system is in triangular form; that is, the variable x doesn't appear in the second
equation, andc the variables x and y do not appear in the third equation.A system of linear equations A system in triangular formx # 2y #   z ! 1 cx # 2y # z ! 1#x " 3y " 3z ! 4 y " 2z ! 5

It's easy to solve a system that is in triangular form by using back-substitution. So our
goal in this section is to start with a system of linear equations and change it to a system
in triangular form that has the same solutions as the original system. We begin by show-
ing how to use back-substitution to solve a system that is already in triangular form.
