Every exponential function f 1x 2 ! ax, with a " 0 and a # 1, is a one-to-one function by
the Horizontal Line Test (see Figure 1 for the case a " 1) and therefore has an inverse
function. The inverse function f$1 is called the logarithmic function with base a and is
denoted by loga. Recall from Section 2.6 that f$1 is
f$1 1x 2 ! y 3  f 1 dy 2efined by0 x ! x
F I G U R E  1 f 1x 2 ! ax is 
one-to-one. This leads to the following definition of the logarithmic function.
DEFINITION OF THE LOGARITHMIC FUNCTION
Let a be a positive number with a # 1. The logarithmic function with base a,
denoted by log a, is defined by
We read loga x ! y as "log base a of loga x ! y 3  ay ! x
x is y."
So loga x is the exponent to which the base a must be raised to give x.
When we use the definition of logarithms to switch back and forth between the loga-
By tradition the name of the logarith- rithmic form logax ! y and the exponential form ay ! x, it is helpful to notice that, in

The logarithmic and exponential forms are equivalent equations: If one is true, then 
so is the other. So we can switch from one form to the other as in the following illus-
trations.
