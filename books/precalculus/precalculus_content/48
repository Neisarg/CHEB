! The Law of Cosines
The Law of Sines cannot be used directly to solve triangles if we know two sides and the
angle between them or if we know all three sides (these are Cases 3 and 4 of the preced-
ing section). In these two cases the Law of Cosines applies.

P R O O F To prove the Law of Cosines, place triangle ABC so that "A is at the origin, as
y shown in Figure 2. The coordinates of vertices B and C are 1c, 0 2 and (b cos A, b sin A),
respectively. (You should check that the coordinates of these points will be the same if we
C(b ç A, b ß A) draw angle A as an ac
 a2 " 1ute angle.) Using the Distance Formula, we getb cos A # c 2 2 $ 1b sin A # 0 2 2

This proves the first formula. The other two formulas are obtained in the same way by
placing each of the other vertices of the triangle at the origin and repeating the preceding
F I G U R E  2 argument. "
In words, the Law of Cosines says that the square of any side of a triangle is equal to
the sum of the squares of the other two sides, minus twice the product of those two sides
times the cosine of the included angle.
If one of the angles of a triangle, say "C, is a right angle, then cos C " 0, and the Law
of Cosines reduces to the Pythagorean Theorem, c2 " a2 $ b2. Thus the Pythagorean
Theorem is a special case of the Law of Cosines.

A tunnel is to be built through a mountain. To estimate the length of the tunnel, a surveyor
makes the measurements shown in Figure 3. Use the surveyor's data to approximate the
