11.4 SHIFTED CONICS
Shifting Graphs of Equations ! Shifted Ellipses ! Shifted Parabolas !
Shifted Hyperbolas ! The General Equation of a Shifted Conic
In the preceding sections we studied parabolas with vertices at the origin and ellipses and
hyperbolas with centers at the origin. We restricted ourselves to these cases because these
equations have the simplest form. In this section we consider conics whose vertices and cen-
ters are not necessarily at the origin, and we determine how this affects their equations.
! Shifting Graphs of Equations
In Section 2.5 we studied transformations of functions that have the effect of shifting their
graphs. In general, for any equation in x and y, if we replace x by x # h or by x ! h, the
graph of the new equation is simply the old graph shifted horizontally; if y is replaced by
y # k or by y ! k, the graph is shifted vertically. The following box gives the details.
SHIFTING GRAPHS OF EQUATIONS
If h and k are positive real numbers, then replacing x by x # h or by x ! h and 
replacing y by y # k or by y ! k has the following effect(s) on the graph of any
equation in x and y.
Replacement How the graph is shifted
1. x replaced by x # h Right h units
2. x replaced by x ! h Left h units
3. y replaced by y # k Upward k units
4. y replaced by y ! k Downward k units
