In this section we study polynomial functions of any degree. But before we work with
polynomial functions, we must agree on some terminology.
POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS
A polynomial function of degree n is a function of the form
P1x 2 ! anxn # a n"1xn"1 # . . . # a1x # a0
where n is a nonnegative integer and an $ 0.
The numbers a0, a1, a2, p , an are called the coefficients of the polynomial. 
The number a0 is the constant coefficient or constant term. 
The number an, the coefficient of the highest power, is the leading coefficient, and
the term an xn is the leading term.
We often refer to polynomial functions simply as polynomials. The following polyno-
mial has degree 5, leading coefficient 3, and constant term "6.

If a polynomial consists of just a single term, then it is called a monomial. For example,
P1x 2 ! x3 and Q1x 2 ! "6x5 are monomials.
! Graphing Basic Polynomial Functions
The graphs of polynomials of degree 0 or 1 are lines (Section 1.10), and the graphs of
polynomials of degree 2 are parabolas (Section 3.1). The greater the degree of a polyno-
mial, the more complicated its graph can be. However, the graph of a polynomial func-

sharp points (cusps) as shown in Figure 1.

The simplest polynomial functions are the monomials

shape as the graph of y ! x2 when n is even and the same general shape as the graph of
y ! x3 when n is odd. However, as the degree n becomes larger, the graphs become flat-
ter around the origin and steeper elsewhere.
