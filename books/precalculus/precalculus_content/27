A rational function is a function of the form
r 1 Px 2 11x 2! Q x 2
where P and Q are polynomials. We assume that P1x 2 and Q1x 2 have no factor in com-
mon. Even though rational functions are constructed from polynomials, their graphs look
quite different from the graphs of polynomial functions.
" Rational Functions and Asymptotes
Domains of rational expressions are The domain of a rational function consists of all real numbers x except those for which
discussed in Section 1.4. the denominator is zero. When graphing a rational function, we must pay special attention
to the behavior of the graph near those x-values. We begin by graphing a very simple ra-
tional function.

We describe this behavior in words and in symbols as follows. The first table shows 
that as x approaches 0 from the left, the values of y ! f 1x 2 decrease without bound. In
symbols,
f 1x 2 !"q as x! 0" "y approaches negative infinity 
as x approaches 0 from the left"
The second table shows that as x approaches 0 from the right, the values of f 1x 2 increase
without bound. I

These tables show that as 0 x 0 becomes large, the value of f 1x 2 gets closer and closer to
zero. We des
f 1crx 2ibe this situation in symbols by writing! 0 as x!"q  and  f 1x 2 ! 0 as x!q
Using the information in these tables and plotting a few additional points, we obtain the
graph shown in Figure 1.
