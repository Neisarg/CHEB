! Systems of Linear Equations and Their Solutions
A linear equation in two variables is an A system of equations is a set of equations that involve the same variables. A system of
equation of the form linear equations is a system of equations in which each equation is linear. A solution
ax " by ! c of a system is an assignment of values for the variables that makes each equation in the
system true. To solve a system means to find all solutions of the system.
The graph of a linear equation is a line
(see Here is an example of a system of linear equations in two variables:Section 1.10). b 2x #  y ! 5 Equation 1
 x " 4y ! 7 Equation 2
We can check that x ! 3 and y ! 1 is a solution of this system.
Equation 1 Equation 2
 2x # y ! 5  x " 4y ! 7
213 2 # 1 ! 5 " 3 " 411 2 ! 7 "
T1 he solution can also be written as the order 13, 1 23, 1 2 13, 1 2ed pair .Note that the graphs of Equations 1 and 2 are lines (see Figure 1). Since the solutionsatisfies each equation, the point lies on each line. So it is the point of inter-
section of the two lines.

! Substitution Method
In the substitution method we start with one equation in the system and solve for one
variable in terms of the other variable. The following box describes the procedure.
SUBSTITUTION METHOD
1. Solve for One Variable. Choose one equation, and solve for one variable in
terms of the other variable.
2. Substitute. Substitute the expression you found in Step 1 into the other
equation to get an equation in one variable, then solve for that variable.
3. Back-Substitute. Substitute the value you found in Step 2 back into the 
expression found in Step 1 to solve for the remaining variable.
