A quotient of two algebraic expressions is called a fractional expression. Here are some
examples:
2x 1x % 3 y $ 2
      
x $ 1 x % 1 y2 % 4
A rational expression is a fractional expression where both the numerator and denomi-
nator are polynomials. For example, the following are rational expressions:
2x x x3 $ x
     
x $ 1 x 2
 
% 1 x 2 $ 5x % 6
In this section we learn how to perform algebraic operations on rational expressions.
! The Domain of an Algebraic Expression
Expression Domain In general, an algebraic expression may not be defined for all values of the variable. The

Denominator would be 0 if 
x ! 2 or x ! 3
Since the denominator is zero w5 hen x ! 2 or 3, thex 0  x # 2 and x # 36 expression is not defined forthese numbers. The domain is .
(c) For the numerator to be defined, we must have x " 0. Also, we cannot divide by
zero, so x # 5.

! Simplifying Rational Expressions
To simplify rational expressions, we factor both numerator and denominator and use the
following property of fractions:
AC A
!
BC B
This allows us to cancel common factors from the numerator and denominator.
