3.3 DIVIDING POLYNOMIALS
Long Division of Polynomials ! Synthetic Division ! The Remainder 
and Factor Theorems
So far in this chapter we have been studying polynomial functions graphically. In this sec-
tion we begin to study polynomials algebraically. Most of our work will be concerned
with factoring polynomials, and to factor, we need to know how to divide polynomials.
! Long Division of Polynomials
Dividing polynomials is much like the familiar process of dividing numbers. When we di-
vide 38 by 7, the quotient is 5 and the remainder is 3. We write

ensure that the columns line up correctly.

The process is complete at this point because "7x # 1 is of lesser degree than the divi-
