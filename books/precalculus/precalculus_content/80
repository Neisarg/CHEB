! Geometric Definition of a Hyperbola
Although ellipses and hyperbolas have completely different shapes, their definitions and
equations are similar. Instead of using the sum of distances from two fixed foci, as in the
case of an ellipse, we use the difference to define a hyperbola.
GEOMETRIC DEFINITION OF A HYPERBOL A
y A hyperbola is the set of all points in the plane, the difference of whose dis-
tances from two fixed points F1 and F2 is a constant. (See Figure 1.) These two
P(x, y) fixed points are the foci of the hyperbola.
F⁄(_c, 0) 0 F¤(c, 0) x As in the case of the ellipse, we get the simplest equation for the hyperbola by placing
the foci on the x-axis at , as shown in Figure 1. By definition, if lies on the
hyperbola, then either d11&c, 0 2P, F1 2 # d1P, F2 2 or d1P, F2 2 # d1P, F1 2 P1x, y 2must equal some pos-
itive constant, which we call 2a. Thus we have

Asymptotes of rational functions are The asymptotes mentioned in this box are lines that the hyperbola approaches for large

tion for y to get

As x gets large, a2/x2 gets closer to zero. In other words, as x!q, we have a2/x2 ! 0. So
for large x the value of y can be approximated as y " &1b/a 2x. This shows that these lines
are asymptotes of the hyperbola.
Asymptotes are an essential aid for graphing a hyperbola; they help us to determine its
shape. A convenient way to find the asymptotes, for a hyperbola with horizontal trans-
verse axis, is to first plot the points 1a, 0 2 , 1#a, 0 2 , 10, b 2 , and 10, #b 2 . Then sketch hor-
izontal and vertical segments through these points to construct a rectangle, as shown in
Figure 
y " &12(a).b/a 2 We call this rectangle the central box of the hyperbola. The slopes of the di-agonals of the central box are &b/a, so by extending them, we obtain the asymptotesx, as sketched in Figure 2(b). Finally, we plot the vertices and use the as-
ymptotes as a guide in sketching the hyperbola shown in Figure 2(c). (A similar proce-
dure applies to graphing a hyperbola that has a vertical transverse axis.)

HOW TO SKETCH A HYPERBOL A
1. Sketch the Central Box. This is the rectangle centered at the origin, with
sides parallel to the axes, that crosses one axis at &a, the other at &b.
2. Sketch the Asymptotes. These are the lines obtained by extending the diag-
onals of the central box.
3. Plot the Vertices. These are the two x-intercepts or the two y-intercepts.
4. Sketch the Hyperbola. Start at a vertex, and sketch a branch of the hyper-
bola, approaching the asymptotes. Sketch the other branch in the same way.

vertices and foci are on the x-axis. Since a2 " 16 and b2 " 9, we get a " 4, b " 3,
