2.5 TRANSFORMATIONS OF FUNCTIONS
Vertical Shifting ! Horizontal Shifting ! Reflecting Graphs ! Vertical
Stretching and Shrinking ! Horizontal Stretching and Shrinking ! Even 
and Odd Functions
In this section we study how certain transformations of a function affect its graph. This
will give us a better understanding of how to graph functions. The transformations that we
study are shifting, reflecting, and stretching.
! Vertical Shifting
Adding a constant to a function shifts its graph vertically: upward if the constant is posi-
tive and downward if it is negative.
In general, suppose we know the graph of y ! f 1x 2 . How do we obtain from it the
graphs of
Recall that the graph of the function f
is the same as the graph of the equation y ! f 1x 2 % c  and  y ! f 1x 2 $ c  1c ' 0 2
y ! f 1x 2 . The y-co
y ! f 1orx 2dinate of each point on the graph of y ! f 1x 2 % c is c units above the y-coordinate of the corresponding point on the graph of y ! f 1x 2 . So we obtain the graphof % c simply by shifting the graph of f
y ! f 1x 2 y ! 1x 2 upward c units. Similarly, weobtain the graph of $ c by shifting the graph of y ! f 1x 2 downward c units.

S O L U T I O N The function f 1x 2 ! x2 was graphed in Example 1(a), Section 2.2. It is
sketched again in Figure 1.
(a) Observe that
g1x 2 ! x2 % 3 ! f 1x 2 % 3
So the y-coordinate of each point on the graph of g is 3 units above the correspond-
ing point on the graph of f. This means that to graph g, we shift the graph of f
upward 3 units, as in Figure 1.
(b) Similarly, to graph h, we shift the graph of f downward 2 units, as shown in Figure 1.
