! A Unified Geometric Description of Conics
Earlier in this chapter, we defined a parabola in terms of a focus and directrix, but we
defined the ellipse and hyperbola in terms of two foci. In this section we give a more
unified treatment of all three types of conics in terms of a focus and directrix. If we place
the focus at the origin, then a conic section has a simple polar equation. Moreover, in po-
lar form, rotation of conics becomes a simple matter. Polar equations of ellipses are cru-
cial in the derivation of Kepler's Laws (see page 754).

EQUIVALENT DESCRIPTION OF CONICS
Let F be a fixed point (the focus), / a fixed line (the directrix), and let e be a
fixed positive number (the eccentricity). The set of all points P such that the ra-
tio of the distance from P to F to the distance from P to / is the constant e is a
conic. That is, the set of all points P such that

is a conic. The conic is a parabola if e " 1, an ellipse if e % 1, or a hyperbola if
e $ 1.

we get sin u instead of cos u in the equation. These observations are summarized in the
following box and in Figure 2.

F I G U R E  2 The form of the polar equation of a conic indicates the location of the directrix.
To graph the polar equation of a conic, we first determine the location of the directrix
from the form of the equation. The four cases that arise are shown in Figure 2. (The figure
shows only the parts of the graphs that are close to the focus at the origin. The shape of
the rest of the graph depends on whether the equation represents a parabola, an ellipse, or
a hyperbola.) The axis of a conic is perpendicular to the directrix-specifically we have
the following:
1. For a parabola the axis of symmetry is perpendicular to the directrix.
2. For an ellipse the major axis is perpendicular to the directrix.
3. For a hyperbola the transverse axis is perpendicular to the directrix.
