7ANALYTIC TRIGONOMETRY
7.1 Trigonometric Identities In Chapters 5 and 6 we studied graphical and geometric properties of the
7.2 Addition and Subtraction trigonometric functions. In this chapter we study algebraic properties of these
Formulas functions, that is, simplifying and factoring expressions and solving equations
that involve trigonometric functions. 
7.3 Double-Angle, Half-Angle, and We have used the trigonometric functions to model different real-world 
Product-Sum Formulas phenomena, including periodic motion (such as the motion of an ocean wave).
7.4 Basic Trigonometric Equations To obtain information from a model, we often need to solve equations. If the
model involves trigonometric functions, we need to solve trigonometric 
7.5 More Trigonometric Equations equations. Solving trigonometric equations often involves using trigonometric
FOCUS ON MODELING identities. We've already encountered some basic trigonometric identities in 
Traveling and Standing Waves the preceding chapters. We begin this chapter by finding many new identities.
