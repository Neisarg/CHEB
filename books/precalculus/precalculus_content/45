6.3 TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS OF ANGLES
Trigonometric Functions of Angles ! Evaluating Trigonometric Functions 
at Any Angle ! Trigonometric Identities ! Areas of Triangles
In the preceding section we defined the trigonometric ratios for acute angles. Here we ex-
tend the trigonometric ratios to all angles by defining the trigonometric functions of an-
gles. With these functions we can solve practical problems that involve angles that are not
necessarily acute.

Then P " P1x, y 2 is a point on the terminal side of u. In triangle POQ, the opposite side

P(x, y) that the hypotenuse has length r " 2x2 $ y2. So

These observations allow us to extend the trigonometric ratios to any angle. We define

DEFINITION OF THE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Let u be an angle in standard position and let 
r " 2 P1x, y 2 be a point on the terminalside. If x2 $ y2 is the distance from the origin to the point P1x, y 2 , then

P'(x', y')
P(x, y) Since division by 0 is an undefined operation, certain trigonometric functions are notdefined for certain angles. For example, tan 90! " y/x is undefined because x " 0. The
angles for which the trigonometric functions may be undefined are the angles for which
either the x- or y-coordinate of a point on the terminal side of the angle is 0. These are
¨ quadrantal angles-angles that are coterminal with the coordinate axes.
O Q Q' x It is a crucial fact that the values of the trigonometric functions do not depend on the
choice of the point P1x, y 2 . This is because if P¿ 1x¿, y¿ 2 is any other point on the terminal
F I G U R E  3 side, as in Figure 3, then triangles POQ and P(OQ( are similar.
! Evaluating Trigonometric Functions at Any Angle
From the definition we see that the values of the trigonometric functions are all positive
if the angle u has its terminal side in Quadrant I. This is because x and y are positive in
this quadrant. [Of course, r is always positive, since it is simply the distance from the ori-
gin to the point P1x, y 2 .] If the terminal side of u is in Quadrant II, however, then x is
