6.6 Trapezoids

Here you'll learn what a trapezoid is and what properties it possesses.

What if you were told that the polygonABCD is an isosceles trapezoid and that one of its base angles measures 38◦?

What can you conclude about its other base angle? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to find the value

of a trapezoid's unknown angles and sides.

A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with exactly one pair of parallel sides.

An isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid where the non-parallel sides are congruent.

The base angles of an isosceles trapezoid are congruent. If ABCD is an isosceles trapezoid, then 6 A ∼= 6 B and

6 C ∼= 6 D.

The converse is also true. If a trapezoid has congruent base angles, then it is an isosceles trapezoid. The diagonals

of an isosceles trapezoid are also congruent. The midsegment (of a trapezoid) is a line segment that connects the

midpoints of the non-parallel sides:

There is only one midsegment in a trapezoid. It will be parallel to the bases because it is located halfway between

them.

Midsegment Theorem: The length of the midsegment of a trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the bases.

If EF is the midsegment, then EF = AB+CD2 .

Example A

Look at trapezoid T RAP below. What is m6 A?

T RAP is an isosceles trapezoid. m6 R = 115◦ also.

To find m 6 A, set up an equation.

To find m 6 A, set up an equation.

115◦+115◦+m6 A+m6 P = 360◦
230◦+2m6 A = 360◦ → m6 A = m6 P
2m6 A = 130◦
m6 A = 65◦
Notice that m6 R+m 6 A= 115◦+65◦= 180◦. These angles will always be supplementary because of the Consecutive
Interior Angles Theorem.
Example B
Is ZOID an isosceles trapezoid? How do you know?
40◦ 6= 35◦, ZOID is not an isosceles trapezoid.
Example C

Answer:
a) x is the average of 12 and 26. 12+262 =
38
2 = 19
b) 24 is the average of x and 35.
x+35
= 24

x+35 = 48
x = 13
c) 20 is the average of 5x−15 and 2x−8.
5x−15+2x−8
= 20

7x−23 = 40
7x = 63
x = 9

T RAP an isosceles trapezoid.
Find:
1. m6 T PA
2. m6 PT R
3. m6 PZA
4. m6 ZRA
318
www.ck12.org Chapter 6. Polygons and Quadrilaterals
Answers:
1. 6 T PZ ∼= 6 RAZ so m 6 T PA = 20◦+35◦ = 55◦.
2. 6 T PA is supplementary with 6 PT R, so m6 PT R = 125◦.
3. By the Triangle Sum Theorem, 35◦+35◦+m 6 PZA = 180◦, so m6 PZA = 110◦.
4. Since m6 PZA = 110◦, m6 RZA = 70◦ because they form a linear pair. By the Triangle Sum Theorem, m6 ZRA =
90◦.
