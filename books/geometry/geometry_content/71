7.8 Triangle Proportionality

Here you'll learn how to apply both the Triangle Proportionality Theorem, which states that if a line that is parallel

to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally, and its converse.

What if you were given a triangle with a line segment drawn through it from one side to the other? How could you

use information about the triangle's side lengths to determine if that line segment is parallel to the third side? After

completing this Concept, you'll be able to answer questions like this one.

James Sousa: Using the Triangle Proportionality Theorem to Solve for Unknown Values

Guidance

Think about a midsegment of a triangle. A midsegment is parallel to one side of a triangle and divides the other two

sides into congruent halves. The midsegment divides those two sides proportionally. But what about another line

that is parallel, but does not divide the other two sides into congruent halves? In fact, such a line will still divide the

sides proportionally. This is called the Triangle Proportionality Theorem.

Triangle Proportionality Theorem: If a line parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides, then it

divides those sides proportionally.

If DE‖AC, then BDDA = BEEC . ( DABD = ECBE is also a true proportion.)

The converse of this theorem is also true.

Triangle Proportionality Theorem Converse: If a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it is

parallel to the third side.

If BDDA =

BE

EC , then DE‖AC.

Example A

A triangle with its midsegment is drawn below. What is the ratio that the midsegment divides the sides into?

The midsegment splits the sides evenly. The ratio would be 8:8 or 10:10, which both reduce to 1:1.

Example B

In the diagram below, EB‖CD. Find BC.

To solve, set up a proportion.
