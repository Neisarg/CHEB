4.3 Congruent Triangles

Here you'll learn that two triangles are congruent if they have exactly the same size and shape. You'll then use this

fact to determine if two triangles are congruent.

What if you were given two triangles with all the angle measures and all the side lengths marked? How could you

tell if the two triangles were congruent? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to compare two triangles and

decide whether they have exactly the same size and shape.

James Sousa: Congruent Triangles

Guidance

Two figures are congruent if they have exactly the same size and shape. If two triangles are congruent, they will

have exactly the same three sides and exactly the same three angles. In other words, two triangles are congruent if

you can turn, flip, and/or slide one so it fits exactly on the other.

4ABC and4DEF are congruent because

AB∼= DE 6 A∼= 6 D

BC ∼= EF and 6 B∼= 6 E

AC ∼= DF 6 C ∼= 6 F

Notice that when two triangles are congruent their three pairs of corresponding angles and their three pairs of

corresponding sides are congruent.

When referring to corresponding congruent parts of congruent triangles, you can use the phrase Corresponding Parts

of Congruent Triangles are Congruent, or its abbreviation CPCTC.

Example A

Are the two triangles below congruent?

To determine if the triangles are congruent, match up sides with the same number of tic marks: BC ∼= MN, AB ∼=

LM, AC ∼= LN.

Next match up the angles with the same markings:

6 A∼= 6 L, 6 B∼= 6 M, and 6 C ∼= 6 N.

Lastly, we need to make sure these are corresponding parts. To do this, check to see if the congruent angles are

opposite congruent sides. Here, 6 A is opposite BC and 6 L is opposite MN. Because 6 A ∼= 6 L and BC ∼= MN, they

are corresponding. Doing this check for the other sides and angles, we see that everything matches up and the two

triangles are congruent.

Example B

If all three pairs of angles for two given triangles are congruent does that mean that the triangles are congruent?

Without knowing anything about the lengths of the sides you cannot tell whether or not two triangles are congruent.

The two triangles described above might be congruent, but we would need more information to know for sure.

Example C

Determine if the triangles are congruent using the definition of congruent triangles.

From the tic marks we can see that AB ∼= DE. We also know that 6 ACB ∼= 6 ECD because they are vertical angles.
However, this is not enough information to know whether or not the triangles are congruent.

Answers:
1. We can see from the markings that 6 B ∼= 6 C, 6 A ∼= 6 D, and 6 AEB ∼= 6 DEC because they are vertical angles.
Also, we know that BA ∼= CD, EA ∼= ED, and BE ∼= CE. Because three pairs of sides and three pairs of angles are
all congruent and they are corresponding parts, this means that the two triangles are congruent.
2. While there are congruent corresponding parts, there are only two pairs of congruent sides, the marked ones and
the shared side. Without knowing whether or not the third pair of sides is congruent we cannot say if the triangles are
congruent using the definition of congruent triangles. Note, this does not mean that the triangles are not congruent,
it just means that we need more information in order to say they are congruent using the definition of congruent
triangles (congruent triangles have three pairs of congruent angles and three pairs of congruent sides).
3. We can see from the markings that 6 G ∼= 6 L, 6 F ∼= 6 K, and therefore 6 H ∼= 6 M by the Third Angle Theorem.
Also, we know that MK ∼= FH, GF ∼= LK, and GH ∼= LM. Because three pairs of sides and three pairs of angles are
all congruent and they are corresponding parts, this means that the two triangles are congruent.
