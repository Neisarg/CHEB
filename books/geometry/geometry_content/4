1.4 Midpoints and Segment Bisectors

Here you'll learn what a midpoint, a segment bisector, and a perpendicular bisector are and how to use their properties

to solve for unknown values.

What if you were given the coordinates of two points and you wanted to find the point exactly in the middle of them?

How would you find the coordinates of this third point? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the

Midpoint Formula to find the location of such a point in the coordinate plane.

Guidance

When two segments are congruent, we indicate that they are congruent, or of equal length, with segment markings,

as shown below:

A midpoint is a point on a line segment that divides it into two congruent segments.

Because AB = BC, B is the midpoint of AC. Any line segment will have exactly one midpoint.

When points are plotted in the coordinate plane, we can use a formula to find the midpoint between them.

Here are two points, (-5, 6) and (3, 2).

The midpoint should be halfway between the points on the segment connecting them. Just by looking, it seems like

the midpoint is (-1, 4). (

A segment bisector cuts a line segment into two congruent parts and passes through the midpoint. A perpendicular

bisector is a segment bisector that intersects the segment at a right angle.

Example A
Write all equal segment statements.
AD = DE
FD = DB = DC
Example B
Is M a midpoint of AB?
No, it is not MB = 16 and AM = 34−16 = 18. AM must equal MB in order for M to be the midpoint of AB.
Example C
Find the midpoint between (9, -2) and (-5, 14).
Plug the points into the formula.

Guided Practice
1. If M(3,−1) is the midpoint of AB and B(7,−6), find A.
2. Which line is the perpendicular bisector of MN?
3. Find x and y.
Answers:
1. Plug what you know into the midpoint formula.
(
7+ xA −
)
6+ yA
, = (3,−1)
2 2
7+ xA −6+ yA
= 3 and =−1
2 2
7+ xA = 6 and −6+ yA =−2
xA =−1 and yA = 4
So, A is (−1,4).
←→ ←→
2. The perpendicular bisector must bisect MN and be perpendicular to it. Only OQ fits this description. SR is a
bisector, but is not perpendicular.
3. The line shown is the perpendicular bisector.
So, 3x−6 = 21 And, (4y−2)◦ = 90◦
3x = 27 4y = 92◦
x = 9 y = 23◦
