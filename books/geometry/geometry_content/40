4.7 SAS Triangle Congruence

Here you'll learn how to prove that triangles are congruent given information only about two of their sides and the

angle between those two sides.

What if you were given two triangles and provided with only two of their side lengths and the measure of the angle

between those two sides? How could you determine if the two triangles were congruent? After completing this

Concept, you'll be able to use the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) shortcut to prove triangle congruency.

James Sousa: Example 1: Prove Two Triangles are Congruent

Guidance

If two sides and the included angle in one triangle are congruent to two sides and the included angle in another

triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. (When an angle is between two given sides of a polygon it is called

an included angle.)

AC ∼= XZ, BC ∼= Y Z, and 6 C ∼= 6 Z, then4ABC ∼=4XY Z.

This is called the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Postulate and it is a shortcut for proving that two triangles are congruent.

The placement of the word Angle is important because it indicates that the angle you are given is between the two

sides.

6 B would be the included angle for sides AB and BC.

Example A

What additional piece of information do you need to show that these two triangles are congruent using the SAS

Postulate?

triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. (When an angle is between two given sides of a polygon it is called
an included angle.)

a) 6 ABC ∼= 6 LKM
b) AB∼= LK
c) BC ∼= KM
d) 6 BAC ∼= 6 KLM
For the SAS Postulate, you need the side on the other side of the angle. In 4ABC, that is BC and in 4LKM that is
KM. The answer is c.
Example B
Write a two-column proof to show that the two triangles are congruent.
Given: C is the midpoint of AE and DB
Prove: 4ACB∼=4ECD
TABLE 4.6:
Statement Reason
1. C is the midpoint of AE and DB 1. Given
2. AC ∼=CE, BC ∼=CD 2. Definition of a midpoint
3. 6 ACB∼= 6 DCE 3. Vertical Angles Postulate
4. 4ACB∼=4ECD 4. SAS Postulate
Example C
Is the pair of triangles congruent? If so, write the congruence statement and why.
While the triangles have two pairs of sides and one pair of angles that are congruent, the angle is not in the same place
in both triangles. The first triangle fits with SAS, but the second triangle is SSA. There is not enough information
for us to know whether or not these triangles are congruent.

Answers:
1. The pair of triangles is congruent by the SAS postulate. 4CAB∼=4QRS.
2. We know that one pair of sides and one pair of angles are congruent from the diagram. In order to know that the
triangles are congruent by SAS we need to know that the pair of sides on the other side of the angle are congruent.
So, we need to know that EF ∼= BA.
