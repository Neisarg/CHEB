6.8 Quadrilateral Classification

Here you'll learn how to differentiate among parallelograms, rectangles, rhombuses, squares, kites, trapezoids, and

quadrilaterals in the coordinate plane.

What if you were given the coordinates of four points that form a quadrilateral? How could you determine if that

quadrilateral qualifies as one of the special four-sided figures you learned about in the previous Concepts? After

completing this Concept, you'll be able to make such a determination.

CK-12 Classifying Quadrilaterals in the Coordinate Plane

Guidance

In order to be successful in this concept you need to already be familiar with the definitions and properties of the

following quadrilaterals: parallelograms, rhombuses, rectangles, squares, kites and trapezoids. The definitions for

each are provided in the vocabulary section as a resource, and further information can be found by searching on

those topic words.

When working in the coordinate plane, you will sometimes want to know what type of shape a given shape is. You

should easily be able to tell that it is a quadrilateral if it has four sides. But how can you classify it beyond that?

First you should graph the shape if it has not already been graphed. Look at it and see if it looks like any special

quadrilateral. Do the sides appear to be congruent? Do they meet at right angles? This will give you a place to start.

Once you have a guess for what type of quadrilateral it is, your job is to prove your guess. To prove that a quadrilateral

is a parallelogram, rectangle, rhombus, square, kite or trapezoid, you must show that it meets the definition of that

shape OR that it has properties that only that shape has.

If it turns out that your guess was wrong because the shape does not fulfill the necessary properties, you can guess

again. If it appears to be no type of special quadrilateral then it is simply a quadrilateral.

The examples below will help you to see what this process might look like.

Example A

Determine what type of parallelogram TUNE is: T (0,10),U(4,2),N(−2,−1), and E(−6,7).

This looks like a rectangle. Let's see if the diagonals are equal. If they are, then TUNE is a rectangle.

√ √

EU = √(−6−4)2 +(7−2)2 T N = √(0+2)2 +(10+1)2

= (−10)2 +52 = 22 +112

√ √

= √100+25 = √4+121

= 125 = 125

If the diagonals are also perpendicular, then TUNE is a square.

Slope of EU = 7−2−6−4 =− 510 =−12 Slope of T N = 10−(−1)0−(−2) = 112

The slope of EU 6= slope of T N, so TUNE is a rectangle.

Example B

A quadrilateral is defined by the four lines y = 2x+1, y =−x+5, y = 2x−4, and y =−x−5. Is this quadrilateral

a parallelogram?

To check if its a parallelogram we have to check that it has two pairs of parallel sides. From the equations we can

see that the slopes of the lines are 2, −1, 2 and −1. Because two pairs of slopes match, this shape has two pairs of

parallel sides and is a parallelogram.

Example C

Determine what type of quadrilateral RSTV is.

This looks like a rectangle. Let's see if the diagonals are equal. If they are, then TUNE is a rectangle.
√ √
EU = √(−6−4)2 +(7−2)2 T N = √(0+2)2 +(10+1)2
= (−10)2 +52 = 22 +112
√ √
= √100+25 = √4+121
= 125 = 125
If the diagonals are also perpendicular, then TUNE is a square.
Slope of EU = 7−2−6−4 =− 510 =−12 Slope of T N = 10−(−1)0−(−2) = 112
The slope of EU 6= slope of T N, so TUNE is a rectangle.
Example B
A quadrilateral is defined by the four lines y = 2x+1, y =−x+5, y = 2x−4, and y =−x−5. Is this quadrilateral
a parallelogram?
To check if its a parallelogram we have to check that it has two pairs of parallel sides. From the equations we can
see that the slopes of the lines are 2, −1, 2 and −1. Because two pairs of slopes match, this shape has two pairs of
parallel sides and is a parallelogram.

Determine what type of quadrilateral RSTV is.

This looks like a kite. Find the lengths of all the sides to check if the adjacent sides are congruent.
√ √
RS = √(−5−2)2 +(7−6)2 ST = √(2−5)2 +(6− (−3))2
= (−7)2 +12 = (−3)2 +92
√ √
= 50 = 90
√ √
RV = √(−5− (−4))2 +(7−0)2 V T = √(−4−5)2 +(0− (−3))2
= (−1)2 +72 = (−9)2 +32
√ √
= 50 = 90
From this we see that the adjacent sides are congruent. Therefore, RSTV is a kite.

1. A quadrilateral is defined by the four lines y = 2x + 1, y = −2x + 5, y = 2x− 4, and y = −2x− 5. Is this
quadrilateral a rectangle?
2. Determine what type of quadrilateral ABCD is. A(−3,3),B(1,5),C(4,−1),D(1,−5).

Answers:
1. To be a rectangle a shape must have four right angles. This means that the sides must be perpendicular to each
other. From the given equations we see that the slopes are 2, −2, 2 and −2. Because the slopes are not opposite
reciprocals of each other, the sides are not perpendicular, and the shape is not a rectangle.
2. First, graph ABCD. This will make it easier to figure out what type of quadrilateral it is. From the graph, we can
tell this is not a parallelogram. Find the slopes of BC and AD to see if they are parallel.
Slope of BC = 5−(−1)1−4 =
6
−3 =−2
Slope of AD = 3−(−5)−3−1 =
8
−4 =−2
BC‖AD, so ABCD is a trapezoid. To determine if it is an isosceles trapezoid, find AB and CD.
√ √
AB = √(−3−1)2 +(3−5)2 ST = √(4−1)2 +(−1− (−5))2
= (−4)2 +(−2)2 = 32 +42
√ √ √
= 20 = 2 5 = 25 = 5
AB 6=CD, therefore this is not an isosceles trapezoid.
3. We will not graph this example. Let's find the length of all four sides.
√ √ √
EF = √(5−11)2 +(−1− (−3))2 FG = (11−5)2 +(−3− (−5))2√ √ √
= √(−6)2 +22 = 40 = √62 +22 = 40
GH = √(5− (−1))2 +(−5− (−3))2 HE =√ √(−1−5)2 +(−3− (−1))2√
= 62 +(−2)2 = 40 = (−6)2 +(−2)2 = 40
All four sides are equal. This quadrilateral is either a rhombus or a square. Let's find the length of the diagonals.

In this chapter, we will start with a review of ratios and proportions. Second, we will introduce the concept of

similarity and apply it to polygons, quadrilaterals and triangles. Then, we will extend proportionality to parallel

lines and dilations. Finally, we conclude with an extension about fractals.
