9.5 Inscribed Angles in Circles

Here you'll learn the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the

measure of its intercepted arc. You'll also learn other inscribed angle theorems and you'll use them to solve problems

about circles.

What if you had a circle with two chords that share a common endpoint? How could you use the arc formed by those

chords to determine the measure of the angle those chords make inside the circle? After completing this Concept,

you'll be able to use the Inscribed Angle Theorem to solve problems like this one.

Guidance

An inscribed angle is an angle with its vertex on the circle and whose sides are chords. The intercepted arc is the

arc that is inside the inscribed angle and whose endpoints are on the angle. The vertex of an inscribed angle can be

anywhere on the circle as long as its sides intersect the circle to form an intercepted arc.

The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted

arc.

m6 ADC = 12 mÂC and mÂC = 2m 6 ADC

Inscribed angles that intercept the same arc are congruent. This is called the Congruent Inscribed Angles Theorem

and is shown below.

6 ADB and 6 ACB intercept ÂB, so m 6 ADB = m6 ACB. Similarly, 6 DAC and 6 DBC intercept D̂C, so m6 DAC =

m6 DBC.

An angle intercepts a semicircle if and only if it is a right angle ( Semicircle Theorem). Anytime a right angle is

inscribed in a circle, the endpoints of the angle are the endpoints of a diameter and the diameter is the hypotenuse.

6 DAB intercepts a semicircle, so m6 DAB = 90◦. 6 DAB is a right angle, so D̂B is a semicircle.

Example A

Find mD̂C and m6 ADB.

From the Inscribed Angle Theorem:

mD̂C = 2 ·45◦ = 90◦

Inscribed angles that intercept the same arc are congruent. This is called the Congruent Inscribed Angles Theorem
and is shown below.
6 ADB and 6 ACB intercept ÂB, so m 6 ADB = m6 ACB. Similarly, 6 DAC and 6 DBC intercept D̂C, so m6 DAC =

An angle intercepts a semicircle if and only if it is a right angle ( Semicircle Theorem). Anytime a right angle is
inscribed in a circle, the endpoints of the angle are the endpoints of a diameter and the diameter is the hypotenuse.
