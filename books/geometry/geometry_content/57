6.3 Parallelograms

Here you'll learn what a parallelogram is and how apply theorems about its sides, angles, and diagonals to solve for

unknown values.

What if you were told that FGHI is a parallelogram and you are given the length of FG and the measure of 6 F? What

can you determine about HI, 6 H, 6 G, and 6 I? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to apply parallelogram

theorems to answer such questions.

A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides.

Notice that each pair of sides is marked parallel (for the last two shapes, remember that when two lines are

perpendicular to the same line then they are parallel). Parallelograms have a lot of interesting properties. (You

can explore the properties of a parallelogram at: http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/quadrilaterals/paralle

Facts about Parallelograms

1) Opposite Sides Theorem: If a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then both pairs of opposite sides are congruent.

If

then

2) Opposite Angles Theorem: If a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then both pairs of opposite angles are congruent.

If

then

3) Consecutive Angles Theorem: If a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then all pairs of consecutive angles are

supplementary.

If

then

m6 A+m6 D = 180◦

m 6 A+m6 B = 180◦

m6 B+m 6 C = 180◦

m 6 C+m6 D = 180◦

4) Parallelogram Diagonals Theorem: If a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then the diagonals bisect each other.

Example A
ABCD is a parallelogram. If m 6 A = 56◦, find the measure of the other angles.
First draw a picture. When labeling the vertices, the letters are listed, in order.
If m6 A = 56◦, then m 6 C = 56◦ by the Opposite Angles Theorem.
m6 A+m6 B = 180◦ by the Consecutive Angles Theorem.
56◦+m6 B = 180◦
m6 B = 124◦ m 6 D = 124◦ because it is an opposite angle to 6 B.
Example B
Find the values of x and y.
Remember that opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent. Set up equations and solve.
6x−7 = 2x+9 y+3 = 12
4x = 16 y = 9
x = 4

Guided Practice
1. Show that the diagonals of FGHJ bisect each other.
294

2. SAND is a parallelogram, SY = 4x−11 and Y N = x+10. Solve for x.
3. Find the measures of a and b in the parallelogram below:
Answers:
1. Find the midpoint of each diagonal.
(− )4+6 5−4
Midpoint of FH : ( , = (1,0.5)2 2
3−1 3− )2
Midpoint of GJ : , = (1,0.5)
2 2
Because they are the same point, the diagonals intersect at each other's midpoint. This means they bisect each other.
2. Because this is a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other and SY ∼= Y N.
SY = Y N
4x−11 = x+10
3x = 21
x = 7
3. Consecutive angles are supplementary so 127◦+m6 b = 180◦ which means that m6 b = 53◦. a and b are alternate
interior angles and since the lines are parallel (since its a parallelogram), that means that m6 a = m6 b = 53◦.
