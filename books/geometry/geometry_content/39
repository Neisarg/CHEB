4.6 SSS Triangle Congruence

Here you'll learn how to prove that triangles are congruent given information only about their sides.

What if you were given two triangles and provided with information only about their side lengths? How could you

determine if the two triangles were congruent? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the Side-Side-

Side (SSS) shortcut to prove triangle congruency.

James Sousa: Determining If Two Triangles are Congruent

Guidance

If 3 sides in one triangle are congruent to 3 sides in another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

BC ∼= Y Z, AB∼= XY , and AC ∼= XZ then4ABC ∼=4XY Z.

This is called the Side-Side-Side (SSS) Postulate and it is a shortcut for proving that two triangles are congruent.

Before, you had to show 3 sides and 3 angles in one triangle were congruent to 3 sides and 3 angles in another

triangle. Now you only have to show 3 sides in one triangle are congruent to 3 sides in another.

Example A

Write a triangle congruence statement based on the picture below:

From the tic marks, we know AB∼= LM, AC ∼= LK, BC ∼= MK. From the SSS Postulate, the triangles are congruent.

Lining up the corresponding sides, we have4ABC ∼=4LMK.

Don't forget ORDER MATTERS when writing congruence statements. Line up the sides with the same number of

tic marks.

Example B

Write a two-column proof to show that the two triangles are congruent.

Given: AB∼= DE

C is the midpoint of AE and DB.

Prove: 4ACB∼=4ECD

Note that you must clearly state the three sets of sides are congruent BEFORE stating the triangles are congruent.
Example C
The only way we will show two triangles are congruent in an x− y plane is using SSS.
Find the lengths of all the line segments from both triangles to see if the two triangles are congruent.
To do this, you need to use the distance formula.
Begin with4ABC and its sides.
√
AB = √(−6− (−2))2 +(5−10)2
= (−4)2 +(−5)2
√
= √16+25
= 41
√
BC = √(−2− (−3))2 +(10−3)2
= (1)2 +(7)2
√
= √1+49 √
= 50 = 5 2
√
AC = √(−6− (−3))2 +(5−3)2
= (−3)2 +(2)2
√
= √9+4
= 13
Now, find the lengths of all the sides in4DEF .

√
DE = √(1−5)2 +(−3−2)2
= (−4)2 +(−5)2
√
= √16+25
= 41
√
EF = √(5−4)2 +(2− (−5))2
= (1)2 +(7)2
√
= √1+49 √
= 50 = 5 2
√
DF = √(1−4)2 +(−3− (−5))2
= (−3)2 +(2)2
√
= √9+4
= 13
AB = DE, BC = EF , and AC = DF , so the two triangles are congruent by SSS.

Now find the sides of4DEF .

DE = √(3−6)2 +(9−4)2

√
EF = √(6−10)2 +(4−7)2

√
DF = √(3−10)2 +(9−7)2

√

No sides have equal measures, so the triangles are not congruent.
