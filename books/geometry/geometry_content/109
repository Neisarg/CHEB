10.8 Circumference

Here you'll learn how to find the distance around, or the circumference of, a circle.

What if you were given the radius or diameter of a circle? How could you find the distance around that circle? After

completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the formula for circumference to solve problems like this one.

Guidance

Circumference is the distance around a circle. The circumference can also be called the perimeter of a circle.

However, we use the term circumference for circles because they are round.

Circumference Formula: C = pid where the diameter d = 2r, or twice the radius. So C = 2pir as well.

pi, or "pi" is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. It is approximately equal to 3.14159265358979323846...

To see more digits of pi, go to http://www.eveandersson.com/pi/digits/ . You should have a pi button on your

calculator. If you don't, you can use 3.14 as an approximation for pi. You can also leave your answers in terms of pi

for many problems.

Example A

Find the circumference of a circle with a radius of 7 cm.

Plug the radius into the formula.

C = 2pi(7) = 14pi≈ 44 cm

Example B

The circumference of a circle is 64pi units. Find the diameter.

Again, you can plug in what you know into the circumference formula and solve for d.

64pi= pid

64 units = d

Example C

A circle is inscribed in a square with 10 in. sides. What is the circumference of the circle? Leave your answer in

terms of pi.

From the picture, we can see that the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of a side. C = 10pi in.

Guided Practice

1. Find the perimeter of the square in Example C. Is it more or less than the circumference of the circle? Why?

2. The tires on a compact car are 18 inches in diameter. How far does the car travel after the tires turn once? How

far does the car travel after 2500 rotations of the tires?

3. Find the radius of circle with circumference 88 in.
Answers:
1. The perimeter is P = 4(10) = 40 in. In order to compare the perimeter with the circumference we should change
the circumference into a decimal.
C = 10pi≈ 31.42 in. This is less than the perimeter of the square, which makes sense because the circle is inside the
square.
2. One turn of the tire is the circumference. This would be C = 18pi ≈ 56.55 in. 2500 rotations would be 2500 ·
56.55 in approx141,375 in, 11,781 ft, or 2.23 miles.
