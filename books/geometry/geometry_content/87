8.10 Inverse Trigonometric Ratios

Here you'll learn how to apply the three inverse trigonometric ratios, the inverse sine, the inverse cosine, and the

inverse tangent, to find angle measures.

What if you were told the tangent of 6 Z is 0.6494? How could you find the measure of 6 Z? After completing this

Concept, you'll be able to find angle measures by using the inverse trigonometric ratios.

In mathematics, the word inverse means "undo." For example, addition and subtraction are inverses of each other

because one undoes the other. When we use the inverse trigonometric ratios, we can find acute angle measures as

long as we are given two sides.

Example C
Solve the right triangle.
To solve this right triangle, we need to find AB,m6 C and m6 B. Use only the values you are given.
AB: Use the Pythagorean Theorem.
242 +AB2 = 302
576+AB2 = 900
AB2 = 3√24
AB = 324 = 18

Summary
This chapter begins with a review of how to simplify radicals, an important prerequisite technique for working with
the Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem, its converse, and Pythagorean triples are discussed in detail.
Applications of the Pythagorean Theorem are explored including finding missing lengths in right triangles. The
chapter then branches out into applications of special right triangles, namely 45-45-90 and 30-60-90. The connection
between trigonometry and geometry is explored through trigonometric ratios, trigonometry word problems and
inverse trigonometric ratios at the end of this chapter.

Introduction

First, we will define all the parts of circles and explore the properties of tangent lines, arcs, inscribed angles, and

chords. Next, we will learn about angles and segments that are formed by chords, tangents and secants. Lastly, we

will place circles in the coordinate plane and find the equation of and graph circles.
