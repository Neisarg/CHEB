6.1 Interior Angles in Convex Polygons

Here you'll learn how to find the measure of an interior angle of a convex polygon based on the number of sides the

polygon has.

What if you were given an equiangular seven-sided convex polygon? How could you determine the measure of its

interior angles? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the Polygon Sum Formula to solve problems

like this one.

James Sousa: Angles of Convex Polygons

Guidance

The interior angle of a polygon is one of the angles on the inside, as shown in the picture below. A polygon has the

same number of interior angles as it does sides.

The sum of the interior angles in a polygon depends on the number of sides it has. The Polygon Sum Formula

states that for any n−gon, the interior angles add up to (n−2)×180◦.

(8−2)×180◦

6×180◦

1080◦

Once you know the sum of the interior angles in a polygon it is easy to find the measure of ONE interior angle if

the polygon is regular: all sides are congruent and all angles are congruent. Just divide the sum of the angles by the

number of sides.

Regular Polygon Interior Angle Formula: For any equiangular n−gon, the measure of each angle is (n−2)×180◦n .

In the picture below, if all eight angles are congruent then each angle is (8−2)×180

◦

8 =

6×180◦

8 =

1080◦

8 = 135

◦.

Example A

The interior angles of a polygon add up to 1980◦. How many sides does it have?

Use the Polygon Sum Formula and solve for n.

(n−2)×180◦ = 1980◦

180◦n−360◦ = 1980◦

180◦n = 2340◦

n = 13

The polygon has 13 sides.

Example A
The interior angles of a polygon add up to 1980◦. How many sides does it have?
Use the Polygon Sum Formula and solve for n.
(n−2)×180◦ = 1980◦
180◦n−360◦ = 1980◦
180◦n = 2340◦
n = 13
The polygon has 13 sides.

Example B
How many degrees does each angle in an equiangular nonagon have?
First we need to find the sum of the interior angles; set n = 9.
(9−2)×180◦ = 7×180◦ = 1260◦
"Equiangular" tells us every angle is equal. So, each angle is 1260
◦
9 = 140
◦.
Example C
An interior angle in a regular polygon is 135◦. How many sides does this polygon have?
Here, we will set the Regular Polygon Interior Angle Formula equal to 135◦ and solve for n.
(n−2)×180◦
= 135◦
n
180◦n−360◦ = 135◦n
−360◦ =−45◦n
n = 8 The polygon is an octagon.

Answers:
1. From the Polygon Sum Formula we know that a quadrilateral has interior angles that sum to (4−2)×180◦= 360◦.
Write an equation and solve for x.
89◦+(5x−8)◦+(3x+4)◦+51◦ = 360◦
8x = 224
x = 28
2. From the Polygon Sum Formula we know that a pentagon has interior angles that sum to (5−2)×180◦ = 540◦.
Write an equation and solve for x.
x◦+ x◦+2x◦+2x◦+2x◦ = 540◦
8x = 540
x = 67.5
3. Use the Polygon Sum Formula. (100−2)×180◦ = 17,640◦.
