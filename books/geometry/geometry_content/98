9.10 Segments from Secants

Here you'll learn the relationship between the segments that are created when two secants intersect outside a circle.

You'll then use this relationship to solve for unknown circle values.

What if you were given a circle with two secants that intersect outside the circle? How could you use the length

of some of the segments formed by their intersection to determine the lengths of the unknown segments? After

completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the Two Secants Segments Theorem to solve problems like this one.

Segments from Secants CK-12

Guidance

When two secants intersect outside a circle, the circle divides the secants into segments that are proportional with

each other.

Two Secants Segments Theorem: If two secants are drawn from a common point outside a circle and the segments

are labeled as below, then a(a+b) = c(c+d).

Example A

Find the value of x.

9.10. Segments from Secants www.ck12.org

Use the Two Secants Segments Theorem to set up an equation.

18 · (18+ x) = 16 · (16+24)

324+18x = 256+384

18x = 316

5

x = 17

Example B

Find the value of x.

Use the Two Secants Segments Theorem to set up an equation.

x · (x+ x) = 9 ·32

2x2 = 288

x2 = 144

x = 12, x 6=−12 (length is not negative)

Example C

True or False: Two secants will always intersect outside of a circle.

This is false. If the two secants are parallel, they will never intersect. It's also possible for two secants to intersect

inside a circle.
