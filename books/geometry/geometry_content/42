4.9 HL Triangle Congruence

Here you'll learn how to prove that right triangles are congruent given the length of only their hypotenuses and one

of their legs.

What if you were given two right triangles and provided with only the measure of their hypotenuses and one of their

legs? How could you determine if the two right triangles were congruent? After completing this Concept, you'll be

able to use the Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) shortcut to prove right triangle congruency.

James Sousa: Hypotenuse-Leg Congruence Theorem

Guidance

If the hypotenuse and leg in one right triangle are congruent to the hypotenuse and leg in another right triangle, then

the two triangles are congruent. This is called the Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) Congruence Theorem. Note that it will

only work for right triangles.

If4ABC and4XY Z are both right triangles and AB∼= XY and BC ∼= Y Z then4ABC ∼=4XY Z.

Example A

What additional information would you need to prove that these two triangles were congruent using the HL Theo-

rem?

For HL, you need the hypotenuses to be congruent. AC ∼= MN.

Example B

Determine if the triangles are congruent. If they are, write the congruence statement and which congruence postulate

or theorem you used.

We know the two triangles are right triangles. The have one pair of legs that is congruent and their hypotenuses are

congruent. This means that4ABC ∼=4RQP by HL.

Example C

Determine the additional piece of information needed to show the two triangles are congruent by HL.

We already know one pair of legs is congruent and that they are right triangles. The additional piece of information

we need is that the two hypotenuses are congruent, UT ∼= FG.

Guided Practice
1. Determine if the triangles are congruent. If they are, write the congruence statement and which congruence
postulate or theorem you used.
2. Fill in the blanks in the proof below.
Given:
SV ⊥WU
T is the midpoint of SV and WU
Prove: WS∼=UV
TABLE 4.17:
Statement Reason
1. 1.
2. 6 STW and 6 UTV are right angles 2.
3. 3.
4. ST ∼= TV , WT ∼= TU 4.
5. 4STW ∼=4UTV 5.
6. WS∼=UV 6.
3. Explain why the HL Congruence shortcut works.
Answers:
1. All we know is that two pairs of sides are congruent. Since we do not know if these are right triangles, we cannot
use HL. We do not know if these triangles are congruent.
2.
TABLE 4.18:
Statement Reason
1. SV ⊥WU 1. Given
2. 6 STW and 6 UTV are right angles 2. Definition of perpendicular lines.

TABLE 4.18: (continued)
Statement Reason
3. T is the midpoint of SV and WU 3. Given
4. ST ∼= TV , WT ∼= TU 4. Definition of midpoint
5. 4STW ∼=4UTV 5. SAS
6. WS∼=UV 6. CPCTC
Note that even though these were right triangles, we did not use the HL congruence shortcut because we were not
originally given that the two hypotenuses were congruent. The SAS congruence shortcut was quicker in this case.
3. The Pythagorean Theorem, which says, for any right triangle, this equation is true:
(leg)2 +(leg)2 = (hypotenuse)2
What this means is that if you are given two sides of a right triangle, you can always find the third. Therefore, if you
know two sides of a right triangle are congruent to two sides of another right triangle, then you can conclude that
the third sides are also congruent. If three pairs of sides are congruent, then we know the triangles are congruent by
SSS.
