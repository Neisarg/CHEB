3.5 Alternate Exterior Angles

Here you'll learn what alternate exterior angles are and what relationship they have with parallel lines.

What if you were presented with two angles that are on the exterior of two parallel lines cut by a transversal but on

opposite sides of the transversal? How would you describe these angles and what could you conclude about their

measures? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to answer these questions and apply alternate exterior angle

theorems to find the measure of unknown angles.

Guidance

Alternate exterior angles are two angles that are on the exterior of l and m, but on opposite sides of the transversal.

Alternate Exterior Angles Theorem: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the alternate exterior angles

are congruent.

If l||m, then 6 1∼= 6 2.

Converse of the Alternate Exterior Angles Theorem: If two lines are cut by a transversal and the alternate exterior

angles are congruent, then the lines are parallel.

If

then l||m.

Example A

Find the measure of each angle and the value of y.

The angles are alternate exterior angles. Because the lines are parallel, the angles are equal.
(3y+53)◦ = (7y−55)◦
108 = 4y
27 = y
If y = 27, then each angle is [3(27)+53]◦ = 134◦.
Example B
The map below shows three roads in Julio's town.
Julio used a surveying tool to measure two angles at the intersections in this picture he drew (NOT to scale). Julio
wants to know if Franklin Way is parallel to Chavez Avenue.
The 130◦ angle and 6 a are alternate exterior angles. If m6 a = 130◦, then the lines are parallel.
6 a+40◦ = 180◦ by the Linear Pair Postulate
6 a = 140◦
140◦ 6= 130◦, so Franklin Way and Chavez Avenue are not parallel streets.
Example C
Which lines are parallel if 6 AFG∼= 6 IJM?

These two angles are alternate exterior angles so if they are congruent it means that CG||←→HK.
