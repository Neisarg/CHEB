1.9 Linear Pairs

Here you'll learn what linear pairs are and how to solve linear pair problems.

What if you were given two angles of unknown size and were told they form a linear pair? How would you determine

their angle measures? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the definition of linear pair to solve

problems like this one.

Guidance

Two angles are adjacent if they have the same vertex, share a side, and do not overlap 6 PSQ and 6 QSR are adjacent.

A linear pair is two angles that are adjacent and whose non-common sides form a straight line. If two angles are a

linear pair, then they are supplementary (add up to 180◦). 6 PSQ and 6 QSR are a linear pair.

Example A

What is the measure of each angle?

www.ck12.org Chapter 1. Basics of Geometry

These two angles are a linear pair, so they add up to 180◦.

(7q−46)◦+(3q+6)◦ = 180◦

10q−40◦ = 180◦

10q = 220◦

q = 22◦

Plug in q to get the measure of each angle. m6 ABD = 7(22◦)−46◦ = 108◦ m6 DBC = 180◦−108◦ = 72◦

Example B

Are 6 CDA and 6 DAB a linear pair? Are they supplementary?

The two angles are not a linear pair because they do not have the same vertex. They are supplementary because they

add up to 180◦: 120◦+60◦ = 180◦.

Example C

Find the measure of an angle that forms a linear pair with 6 MRS if m6 MRS is 150◦.

Because linear pairs have to add up to 180◦, the other angle must be 180◦−150◦ = 30◦.
