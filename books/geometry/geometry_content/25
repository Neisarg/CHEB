3.4 Alternate Interior Angles

Here you'll learn what alternate interior angles are and what relationship they have with parallel lines.

What if you were presented with two angles that are on the interior of two parallel lines cut by a transversal but on

opposite sides of the transversal? How would you describe these angles and what could you conclude about their

measures? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to answer these questions and apply alternate interior angle

theorems to find the measure of unknown angles.

Guidance

Alternate interior angles are two angles that are on the interior of l and m, but on opposite sides of the transversal.

Alternate Interior Angles Theorem: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the alternate interior angles

are congruent.

If l||m, then 6 1∼= 6 2

Converse of Alternate Interior Angles Theorem: If two lines are cut by a transversal and the alternate interior

angles are congruent, then the lines are parallel.

If

then l||m.

Example A
Find the value of x.
The two given angles are alternate interior angles and equal.
(4x−10)◦ = 58◦
4x = 68
x = 17
Example B
True or false: alternate interior angles are always congruent.
This statement is false, but is a common misconception. Remember that alternate interior angles are only congruent
when the lines are parallel.
Example C
What does x have to be to make a||b?
The angles are alternate interior angles, and must be equal for a||b. Set the expressions equal to each other and solve.
3x+16◦ = 5x−54◦
70 = 2x
35 = x
To make a||b, x = 35.
