6.4 Quadrilaterals that are Parallelograms

Here you'll learn how to apply various quadrilateral theorems to prove that a quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

What if you were given four pairs of coordinates that form a quadrilateral? How could you determine if that

quadrilateral is a parallelogram? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the Parallel Congruent Sides

Theorem and other quadrilateral theorems to solve problems like this one.

CK-12 Proving a Quadrilateral is a Parallelogram

Guidance

Recall that a parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. Even if a quadrilateral is not marked

with having two pairs of sides, it still might be a parallelogram. The following is a list of theorems that will help you

decide if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram or not.

1) Opposite Sides Theorem Converse: If both pairs of opposite sides of a quadrilateral are congruent, then the

figure is a parallelogram.

If

then

2) Opposite Angles Theorem Converse: If both pairs of opposite angles of a quadrilateral are congruent, then the

figure is a parallelogram.

If

then

3) Parallelogram Diagonals Theorem Converse: If the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other, then the

figure is a parallelogram.

If

then

4) Parallel Congruent Sides Theorem: If a quadrilateral has one set of parallel lines that are also congruent, then

it is a parallelogram.

If

then

You can use any of the above theorems to help show that a quadrilateral is a parallelogram. If you are working in the

x− y plane, you might need to know the formulas shown below to help you use the theorems.

• The Slope Formula, y2−y1x2−x√. (Remember that if slopes are the same then lines are parallel).1

• The Distance Formula, ( (x2− x1)2 +(y2− y1)2. (This will help you to show that two sides are congruent).

• The Midpoint Formula, x

Example B
Is quadrilateral EFGH a parallelogram? How do you know?
a) By the Opposite Angles Theorem Converse, EFGH is a parallelogram.
b) EFGH is not a parallelogram because the diagonals do not bisect each other.
Example C
Is the quadrilateral ABCD a parallelogram?

Let's use the Parallel Congruent Sides Theorem to see if ABCD is a parallelogram. First, find the length of AB and
CD using the distance formula.
√ √
AB = √(−1−3)2 +(5−3)2 CD√= (2−6)2 +(−2+4)2
= (−4)2 +22 = (−4)2 +22
√ √
= √16+4 = √16+4
= 20 = 20
Next find the slopes to check if the lines are parallel.
Slope AB = 5−3−1−3 =
2
−4 =−12 Slope CD = −2+42−6 = 2−4 =−12
AB =CD and the slopes are the same (implying that the lines are parallel), so ABCD is a parallelogram.
