9.3 Arcs in Circles

Here you'll learn the properties of arcs and central angles and use them to find the measure of arcs.

What if a circle were divided into pieces by various radii? How could you find the measures of the arcs formed by

these radii? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use central angles to solve problems like this one.

Guidance

A circle has 360◦. An arc is a section of the circle. A semicircle is an arc that measures 180◦.

ÊHG and ÊJG are semicircles

A central angle is the angle formed by two radii with its vertex at the center of the circle. A minor arc is an arc

that is less than 180◦. A major arc is an arc that is greater than 180◦. Always use 3 letters to label a major arc.

The central angle is 6 BAC. The minor arc is B̂C. The major arc is B̂DC.

An arc can be measured in degrees or in a linear measure (cm, ft, etc.). In this concept we will use degree measure.

The measure of a minor arc is the same as the measure of the central angle that corresponds to it. The measure

of a major arc is 360◦ minus the measure of the corresponding minor arc. The measure of the arc formed by two

adjacent arcs is the sum of the measures of the two arcs ( Arc Addition Postulate).

mÂD+mD̂B = mÂDB

Example A

⊙

Find mÂB and mÂDB in C.

mÂB = m6 ACB. So, mÂB = 102◦.

mÂDB = 360◦−mÂB = 360◦−102◦ = 258◦

Example B

⊙

Find the measures of the minor arcs in A. EB is a diameter.

An arc can be measured in degrees or in a linear measure (cm, ft, etc.). In this concept we will use degree measure.
The measure of a minor arc is the same as the measure of the central angle that corresponds to it. The measure
of a major arc is 360◦ minus the measure of the corresponding minor arc. The measure of the arc formed by two
adjacent arcs is the sum of the measures of the two arcs ( Arc Addition Postulate).
mÂD+mD̂B = mÂDB
Example A
⊙
Find mÂB and mÂDB in C.
mÂB = m6 ACB. So, mÂB = 102◦.
mÂDB = 360◦−mÂB = 360◦−102◦ = 258◦
Example B
⊙
Find the measures of the minor arcs in A. EB is a diameter.

Because EB is a diameter, m6 EAB = 180◦. Each arc has the same measure as its corresponding central angle.
mB̂F = m6 FAB = 60◦
mÊF = m6 EAF = 120◦→ 180◦−60◦
mÊD = m6 EAD = 38◦ → 180◦−90◦−52◦
mD̂C = m6 DAC = 90◦
mB̂C = m6 BAC = 52◦
Example C
⊙
Find the measures of the indicated arcs in A. EB is a diameter.
a) mF̂ED
b) mĈDF
c) mD̂FC
Use the Arc Addition Postulate.
a) mF̂ED = mF̂E +mÊD = 120◦+38◦ = 158◦
b) mĈDF = mĈD+mD̂E +mÊF = 90◦+38◦+120◦ = 248◦
c) mD̂FC = mÊD+mÊF +mF̂B+mB̂C = 38◦+120◦+60◦+52◦ = 270◦

2. Are the blue arcs congruent? Explain why or why not.
a)
b)
⊙
3. Find the value of x for C below.
Answers:
1. 6 ACD∼= 6 ECB because they are vertical angles. 6 DCB∼= 6 ACE because they are also vertical angles.
ÂD∼= ÊB and ÂE ∼= D̂B
2. a) ÂD∼= B̂C because they have the same central angle measure and are in the same circle.

b) The two arcs have the same measure, but are not congruent because the circles have different radii.
3. The sum of the measure of the arcs is 360◦ because they make a full circle.
mÂB+mÂD+mD̂B = 360◦
(4x+15)◦+92◦+(6x+3)◦ = 360◦
10x+110◦ = 360◦
10x = 250
x = 25
