2.6 Properties of Equality and Congruence

Here you'll review the properties of equality you learned in Algebra I, be introduced to the properties of congruence,

and learn how to use these properties.

Suppose you know that a circle measures 360 degrees and you want to find what kind of angle one-quarter of a circle

is. After completing this Concept, you'll be able to apply the basic properties of equality and congruence to solve

geometry problems like this one.

Guidance

The basic properties of equality were introduced to you in Algebra I. Here they are again:

• Reflexive Property of Equality: AB = AB

www.ck12.org Chapter 2. Reasoning and Proof

• Symmetric Property of Equality: If m6 A = m 6 B, then m6 B = m6 A

• Transitive Property of Equality: If AB =CD and CD = EF , then AB = EF

• Substitution Property of Equality: If a = 9 and a− c = 5, then 9− c = 5

• Addition Property of Equality: If 2x = 6, then 2x+5 = 6+5 or 2x+5 = 11

• Subtraction Property of Equality: If m 6 x+15◦ = 65◦, then m6 x+15◦−15◦ = 65◦−15◦ or m6 x = 50◦

• Multiplication Property of Equality: If y = 8, then 5 · y = 5 ·8 or 5y = 40

• Division Property of Equality: If 3b = 18, then 3b3 =

18

3 or b = 6

• Distributive Property: 5(2x−7) = 5(2x)−5(7) = 10x−35

Just like the properties of equality, there are properties of congruence. These properties hold for figures and shapes.

• Reflexive Property of Congruence: AB∼= AB or 6 B∼= 6 B

• Symmetric Property of Congruence: If AB ∼= CD, then CD ∼= AB. Or, if 6 ABC ∼= 6 DEF , then 6 DEF ∼=

6 ABC

• Transitive Property of Congruence: If AB∼= CD and CD∼= EF , then AB∼= EF . Or, if 6 ABC ∼= 6 DEF and

6 DEF ∼= 6 GHI, then 6 ABC ∼= 6 GHI

When you solve equations in algebra you use properties of equality. You might not write out the property for each

step, but you should know that there is an equality property that justifies that step. We will abbreviate "Property of

Equality" "PoE" and "Property of Congruence" "PoC" when we use these properties in proofs.

Example A

Solve 2(3x−4)+11 = x−27 and write the property for each step (also called "to justify each step").

2(3x−4)+11 = x−27

6x−8+11 = x−27 Distributive Property

6x+3 = x−27 Combine like terms

6x+3−3 = x−27−3 Subtraction PoE

6x = x−30 Simplify

6x− x = x− x−30 Subtraction PoE

5x =−30 Simplify

5x −30

= Division PoE

5 5

x =−6 Simplify

Example B

AB = 8,BC = 17, and AC = 20. Are points A,B, and C collinear?

Set up an equation using the Segment Addition Postulate.

AB+BC = AC Segment Addition Postulate

8+17 = 20 Substitution PoE

25 6= 20 Combine like terms

Because the two sides of the equation are not equal, A,B and C are not collinear.

Example C
If m6 A+m6 B = 100◦ and m6 B = 40◦, prove that m6 A is an acute angle.
We will use a 2-column format, with statements in one column and their reasons next to it, just like Example A.
m6 A+m6 B = 100◦ Given Information
m6 B = 40◦ Given Information
m6 A+40◦ = 100◦ Substitution PoE
m6 A = 60◦ Subtraction PoE
6 A is an acute angle Definition of an acute angle,m6 A < 90◦
