1.2 Distance Between Two Points

Here you'll learn how to measure the distance between two points on a horizontal or vertical line.

What if you were given the coordinates of two points that form either a vertical or horizontal line? How would

you determine how far apart those two points are? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to determine the

distance between two such points.

James Sousa: Ruler Postulate and Segment Addition Postulate

Guidance

Distance is the measure of length between two points. To measure is to determine how far apart two geometric

objects are. The most common way to measure distance is with a ruler. Inch-rulers are usually divided up by eighth-

inch (or 0.125 in) segments. Centimeter rulers are divided up by tenth-centimeter (or 0.1 cm) segments. Note that

the distance between two points is the absolute value of the difference between the numbers shown on the ruler.

This implies that you do not need to start measuring at "0", as long as you subtract the first number from the second.

The segment addition postulate states that if A, B, and C are collinear and B is between A and C, then AB+BC =AC.

You can find the distances between points in the x-y plane if the lines are horizontal or vertical. If the line is vertical,

find the change in the y−coordinates. If the line is horizontal, find the change in the x−coordinates.

Example A

What is the distance marked on the ruler below? The ruler is in centimeters.

Subtract one endpoint from the other. The line segment spans from 3 cm to 8 cm. |8−3|= |5|= 5

The line segment is 5 cm long. Notice that you also could have done |3−8|= |−5|= 5.

Example B

Make a sketch of OP, where Q is between O and P.

Draw OP first, then place Q on the segment.

Example C

What is the distance between the two points shown below?

Because this line is vertical, look at the change in the y−coordinates.

Guided Practice
1. Draw CD, such that CD = 3.825 in.
2. In the picture from Example B, if OP = 17 and QP = 6, what is OQ?
3. What is the distance between the two points shown below?
Answers:
1. To draw a line segment, start at "0" and draw a segment to 3.825 in.
Put points at each end and label.

www.ck12.org Chapter 1. Basics of Geometry
2. Use the Segment Addition Postulate.
OQ+QP = OP
OQ+6 = 17
OQ = 17−6
OQ = 11
3. Because this line is horizontal, look at the change in the x−coordinates.
|(−4)−3|= |−7|= 7
The distance between the two points is 7 units.
