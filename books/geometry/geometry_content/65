7.2 Proportion Properties

Here you'll learn what a proportion is, the properties of proportions, and how to solve proportions using cross-

multiplication.

What if you were told that a scale model of a python is in the ratio of 1:24? If the model measures 0.75 feet long,

how long is the real python? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to solve problems like this one by using

a proportion.

A proportion is two ratios that are set equal to each other. Usually the ratios in proportions are written in fraction

form. An example of a proportion is 2x = 510. To solve a proportion, you need to cross-multiply. The Cross-

Multiplication Theorem, which allows us to solve proportions using this method, states that if a,b,c, and d are real

numbers, with b 6= 0 and d 6= 0 and if ab = cd , then ad = bc. Cross-multiplying allows us to get rid of the fractions in

our equation. The Cross-Multiplication Theorem has several sub-theorems, called corollaries.

Corollary #1: If a,b,c, and d are nonzero and ab =

c

d , then

a

c =

b

d . Switch b and c.

Corollary #2: If a,b,c, and d are nonzero and ab =

c

d , then

d

b =

c

a . Switch a and d.

Corollary #3: If a,b,c, and d are nonzero and ab =

c

d , then

b

a =

c

d . Flip each ratio upside down.

Corollary #4: If a,b,c, and d are nonzero and ab =

c

d , then

a+b

b =

c+d

d .

Corollary #5: If a,b,c, and d are nonzero and ab =

c

d , then

a−b

b =

c−d

d .

Example B
Your parents have an architect's drawing of their home. On the paper, the house's dimensions are 36 in by 30 in. If
the shorter length of the house is actually 50 feet, what is the longer length?
To solve, first set up a proportion. If the shorter length is 50 feet, then it lines up with 30 in, the shorter length of the
paper dimensions.
30 50
= −→ 30x = 1800
36 x
x = 60 The longer length is 60 feet.
Example C
Suppose we have the proportion 25 =
14
35 . Write three true proportions that follow.
First of all, we know this is a true proportion because you would multiply 25 by
7
7 to get
14
35 . Using the first three
corollaries:
