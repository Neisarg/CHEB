9.9 Segments from Chords

Here you'll learn the relationship that exists between two chords when they intersect to solve for unknown circle

values.

What if you were given a circle with two chords that intersect each other? How could you use the length of some of

the segments formed by their intersection to determine the lengths of the unknown segments? After completing this

Concept, you'll be able to use the Intersecting Chords Theorem to solve problems like this one.

Segments from Chords CK-12

Guidance

When we have two chords that intersect inside a circle, as shown below, the two triangles that result are similar.

This makes the corresponding sides in each triangle proportional and leads to a relationship between the segments

of the chords, as stated in the Intersecting Chords Theorem.

Intersecting Chords Theorem: If two chords intersect inside a circle so that one is divided into segments of length

a and b and the other into segments of length c and d then ab = cd.

b)
Use the Intersecting Chords Theorem.
a)
8 ·24 = (3x+1) ·12
192 = 36x+12
180 = 36x
5 = x
b)
(x−5)21 = (x−9)24
21x−105 = 24x−216
111 = 3x
37 = x
Example C
Ishmael found a broken piece of a CD in his car. He places a ruler across two points on the rim, and the length of
the chord is 9.5 cm. The distance from the midpoint of this chord to the nearest point on the rim is 1.75 cm. Find
the diameter of the CD.
Think of this as two chords intersecting each other. If we were to extend the 1.75 cm segment, it would be a diameter.
So, if we find x in the diagram below and add it to 1.75 cm, we would find the diameter.
4.25 ·4.25 = 1.75 · x
18.0625 = 1.75x
x≈ 10.3 cm, making the diameter10.3+1.75≈ 12 cm, which is the
actual diameter of a CD.
