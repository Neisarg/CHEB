3.9 Perpendicular Lines in the Coordinate

Plane

Here you'll learn that the slopes of perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals of each other. You'll then apply this

fact to determine if two lines are perpendicular and to find what their equations are.

What if you were given two perpendicular lines in the coordinate plane? What could you say about their slopes?

After completing this Concept, you'll be able to answer this question. You'll also find the equations of perpendicular

lines and determine if two lines are perpendicular based on their slopes.

CK-12 Perpendicular Lines in the Coordinate Plane

Guidance

Perpendicular lines are two lines that intersect at a 90◦, or right, angle. In the coordinate plane, that would look

like this:

If we take a closer look at these two lines, the slope of one is -4 and the other is 14 .

This can be generalized to any pair of perpendicular lines in the coordinate plane. The slopes of perpendicular lines

are opposite reciprocals of each other.

Example A

Find the equation of the line that is perpendicular to y =−13 x+4 and passes through (9, -5).

First, the slope is the opposite reciprocal of −13 . So, m = 3. Plug in 9 for x and -5 for y to solve for the new

y−intercept (b).

−5 = 3(9)+b

−5 = 27+b

−32 = b

Therefore, the equation of the perpendicular line is y = 3x−32.

Example B

Graph 3x−4y = 8 and 4x+3y = 15. Determine if they are perpendicular.

First, we have to change each equation into slope-intercept form. In other words, we need to solve each equation for

y.

3x−4y = 8 4x+3y = 15

−4y =−3x+8 3y =−4x+15

y = x− 42 y =− x+5

Now that the lines are in slope-intercept form (also called y−intercept form), we can tell they are perpendicular

because their slopes are opposite reciprocals.

Example C

Find the equation of the line that is perpendicular to the line y = 2x+7 and goes through the point (2, -2).

The perpendicular line goes through (2, -2), but the slope is −12 because we need to take the opposite reciprocal of

Guided Practice
Find the slope of the lines that are perpendicular to the lines below.
1. y = 2x+3
2. y =−23 x−5
3. y = x+2
Answers:
1. m = 2, so m⊥ is the opposite reciprocal, m⊥ =−12 .
2. m =−23 , take the reciprocal and change the sign, m⊥ = 32 .
3. Because there is no number in front of x, the slope is 1. The reciprocal of 1 is 1, so the only thing to do is make it
negative, m⊥ =−1.
