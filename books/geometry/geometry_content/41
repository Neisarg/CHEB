4.8 ASA and AAS Triangle Congruence

Here you'll learn how to prove that triangles are congruent given information only about two of their angles and one

of their sides.

What if you were given two triangles and provided with only the measure of two of their angles and one of their side

lengths? How could you determine if the two triangles were congruent? After completing this Concept, you'll be

able to use the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) and Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) shortcuts to prove triangle congruency.

James Sousa: Example 2: Prove Two Triangles are Congruent

Guidance

If two angles and one side in one triangle are congruent to the corresponding two angles and one side in another

triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. This idea encompasses two triangle congruence shortcuts: Angle-

Side-Angle and Angle-Angle-Side.

Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) Congruence Postulate: If two angles and the included side in one triangle are congruent

to two angles and the included side in another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) Congruence Theorem: If two angles and a non-included side in one triangle are congru-

ent to two angles and the corresponding non-included side in another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

The placement of the word Side is important because it indicates where the side that you are given is in relation to

the angles. The pictures below help to show the difference between the two shortcuts.

Guidance
If two angles and one side in one triangle are congruent to the corresponding two angles and one side in another
triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. This idea encompasses two triangle congruence shortcuts: Angle-
Side-Angle and Angle-Angle-Side.
Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) Congruence Postulate: If two angles and the included side in one triangle are congruent
to two angles and the included side in another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.
Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) Congruence Theorem: If two angles and a non-included side in one triangle are congru-
ent to two angles and the corresponding non-included side in another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

a) AB∼=UT
b) AC ∼=UV
c) BC ∼= TV
d) 6 B∼= 6 T
For ASA, we need the side between the two given angles, which is AC and UV . The answer is b.
Example B
Write a 2-column proof.
Given: 6 C ∼= 6 E, AC ∼= AE
Prove: 4ACF ∼=4AEB

Statement Reason

2. 6 A∼= 6 A 2. Reflexive PoC
3. 4ACF ∼=4AEB 3. ASA
Example C
What information do you need to prove that these two triangles are congruent using:
a) ASA?
b) AAS?
Solution:
a) For ASA, we need the angles on the other side of EF and QR. 6 F ∼= 6 Q
b) For AAS, we would need the other angle. 6 G∼= 6 P

1. We cannot show the triangles are congruent because KL and ST are not corresponding, even though they are
congruent. To determine if KL and ST are corresponding, look at the angles around them, 6 K and 6 L and 6 S and
6 T . 6 K has one arc and 6 L is unmarked. 6 S has two arcs and 6 T is unmarked. In order to use AAS, 6 S needs to be
congruent to 6 K.
