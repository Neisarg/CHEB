4.10 Isosceles Triangles

Here you'll learn the definition of an isosceles triangle as well as two theorems about isosceles triangles: 1) The

angle bisector of the vertex is the perpendicular bisector of the base; and 2) The base angles are congruent.

What if you were presented with an isosceles triangle and told that its base angles measure x◦ and y◦? What could

you conclude about x and y? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to apply important properties about

isosceles triangles to help you solve problems like this one.

An isosceles triangle is a triangle that has at least two congruent sides. The congruent sides of the isosceles triangle

are called the legs. The other side is called the base. The angles between the base and the legs are called base

angles. The angle made by the two legs is called the vertex angle. One of the important properties of isosceles

triangles is that their base angles are always congruent. This is called the Base Angles Theorem.

For4DEF , if DE ∼= EF , then 6 D∼= 6 F .

Another important property of isosceles triangles is that the angle bisector of the vertex angle is also the perpendicu-

lar bisector of the base. This is called the Isosceles Triangle Theorem. (Note this is ONLY true of the vertex angle.)

The converses of the Base Angles Theorem and the Isosceles Triangle Theorem are both true as well.

Base Angles Theorem Converse: If two angles in a triangle are congruent, then the sides opposite those angles are

also congruent. So for4DEF , if 6 D∼= 6 F , then DE ∼= EF .

Isosceles Triangle Theorem Converse: The perpendicular bisector of the base of an isosceles triangle is also the

angle bisector of the vertex angle. So for isosceles4DEF , if EG⊥ DF and DG∼= GF , then 6 DEG∼= 6 FEG.

Example A
Which two angles are congruent?
This is an isosceles triangle. The congruent angles are opposite the congruent sides. From the arrows we see that
6 S∼= 6 U .
Example B
If an isosceles triangle has base angles with measures of 47◦, what is the measure of the vertex angle?
Draw a picture and set up an equation to solve for the vertex angle, v. Remember that the three angles in a triangle
always add up to 180◦.
47◦+47◦+ v = 180◦
v = 180◦−47◦−47◦
v = 86◦
Example C
If an isosceles triangle has a vertex angle with a measure of 116◦, what is the measure of each base angle?
222
www.ck12.org Chapter 4. Triangles and Congruence
Draw a picture and set up and equation to solve for the base angles, b.
116◦+b+b = 180◦
2b = 64◦
b = 32◦

Guided Practice
1. Find the value of xand the measure of each angle.
2. Find the measure of x.
3. True or false: Base angles of an isosceles triangle can be right angles.
Answers:
1. The two angles are equal, so set them equal to each other and solve for x.
(4x+12)◦ = (5x−3)◦
15 = x
Substitute x = 15; the base angles are [4(15)+12]◦, or 72◦. The vertex angle is 180◦−72◦−72◦ = 36◦.
2. The two sides are equal, so set them equal to each other and solve for x.
223
4.10. Isosceles Triangles www.ck12.org
2x−9 = x+5
x = 14
3. This statement is false. Because the base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent, if one base angle is a right
angle then both base angles must be right angles. It is impossible to have a triangle with two right (90◦) angles. The
Triangle Sum Theorem states that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180◦. If two of the angles in a triangle
are right angles, then the third angle must be 0◦ and the shape is no longer a triangle.
