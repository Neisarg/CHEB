11.7 Spheres

Here you'll learn what a sphere is and how to find its volume and surface area.

What if you were given a solid figure consisting of the set of all points, in three-dimensional space, that are

equidistant from a point? How could you determine how much two-dimensional and three-dimensional space that

figure occupies? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to find the surface area and volume of a sphere.

Guidance

A sphere is the set of all points, in three-dimensional space, which are equidistant from a point. The radius has one

endpoint on the sphere and the other endpoint at the center of that sphere. The diameter of a sphere must contain

the center.

A great circle is the largest circular cross-section in a sphere. The circumference of a sphere is the circumference

of a great circle. Every great circle divides a sphere into two congruent hemispheres.

Surface Area

Surface area is a two-dimensional measurement that is the total area of all surfaces that bound a solid. The basic

unit of area is the square unit. The best way to understand the surface area of a sphere is to watch the link by Russell

Knightley, http://www.rkm.com.au/ANIMATIONS/animation-Sphere-Surface-Area-Derivation.html

Surface Area of a Sphere: SA = 4pir2.

Volume

To find the volume of any solid you must figure out how much space it occupies. The basic unit of volume is the

cubic unit. To see an animation of the volume of a sphere, see http://www.rkm.com.au/ANIMATIONS/animation-S

Example A

The circumference of a sphere is 26pi f eet. What is the radius of the sphere?

The circumference is referring to the circumference of a great circle. Use C = 2pir.

2pir = 26pi

r = 13 f t.

Example B

Find the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 14 feet.

Use the formula.

SA = 4pi(14)2

= 784pi f t2

Guided Practice
1. Find the surface area of the figure below, a hemisphere with a circular base added.
2. The surface area of a sphere is 100pi in2. What is the radius?
3. A sphere has a volume of 14,137.167 f t3. What is the radius?
Answers:
1. Use the formula for surface area.
1
SA = pir2 + 4pir2
2
= pi(62)+2pi(62)
= 36pi+72pi= 108pi cm2
2. Use the formula for surface area.

11.7. Spheres www.ck12.org
SA = 4pir2
100pi= 4pir2
25 = r2
5 = r
3. Use the formula for volume, plug in the given volume and solve for the radius, r.
4
V = pir3

4
14,137.167 = pir3

3 ·14,137.167 = r3
4pi
3375≈ r3
At this point, you will need to take the cubed root of 3375. Your calculator might have a button that looks like √3 ,
1
or you can do 3375 3 .
√3
3375 = 15≈ r
