7.10 Proportions with Angle Bisectors

Here you'll learn how to apply the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that if a ray bisects an angle of a triangle,

then it divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the lengths of the other two sides.

What if you were told that a ray was an angle bisector of a triangle? How would you use this fact to find unknown

values regarding the triangle's side lengths? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the Angle Bisector

Theorem to solve such problems.

James Sousa: Using the Triangle Angle Bisector Theorem to Determine Unknown Values

Guidance

When an angle within a triangle is bisected, the bisector divides the triangle proportionally. This idea is called the

Angle Bisector Theorem.

Angle Bisector Theorem: If a ray bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments that

are proportional to the lengths of the other two sides.

If4BAC ∼=4CAD, then BCCD = ABAD .

Example A

Find x.

The ray is the angle bisector and it splits the opposite side in the same ratio as the other two sides. The proportion is:

9 21

=

x 14

21x = 126

x = 6

Example B

Find the value of x that would make the proportion true.

You can set up this proportion like the previous example.

Answers:
1. Set up a proportion and solve.
20 25
=
8 y
20y = 200
y = 10
2. Set up a proportion and solve.
20 15
=
y 28− y
15y = 20(28− y)
15y = 560−20y
35y = 560
y = 16
