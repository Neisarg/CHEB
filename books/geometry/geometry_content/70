7.7 SAS Similarity

Here you'll learn how to determine if triangles are similar using Side-Angle-Side (SAS).

What if you were given a pair of triangles, the lengths of two of their sides, and the measure of the angle between

those two sides? How could you use this information to determine if the two triangles are similar? After completing

this Concept, you'll be able to use the SAS Similarity Theorem to decide if two triangles are congruent.

By definition, two triangles are similar if all their corresponding angles are congruent and their corresponding sides

are proportional. It is not necessary to check all angles and sides in order to tell if two triangles are similar. In fact,

if you know only that two pairs of sides are proportional and their included angles are congruent, that is enough

information to know that the triangles are similar. This is called the SAS Similarity Theorem.

SAS Similarity Theorem: If two sides in one triangle are proportional to two sides in another triangle and the

included angle in both are congruent, then the two triangles are similar.

If ABXY =

AC

XZ and 6 A∼= 6 X , then4ABC ∼4XY Z.

Example A

Are the two triangles similar? How do you know?

We know that 6 B∼= 6 Z because they are both right angles and 1015 = 2436 . So, ABXZ = BCZY and4ABC ∼4XZY by SAS.

Example B

Are there any similar triangles in the figure? How do you know?

6 A is shared by4EAB and4DAC, so it is congruent to itself. Let's see if AEAD = ABAC .

From Example B, what should BC equal for4EAB∼4DAC?
The proportion we ended up with was 912 =

4 6= 1217 . AC needs to equal 16, so that 1216 = 34 . AC = AB+BC and
16 = 12+BC. BC should equal 4.

1. We can see that 6 B ∼= 6 F and these are both included angles. We just have to check that the sides around the
angles are proportional.

Since the ratios are the same4ABC ∼4DFE by the SAS Similarity Theorem.
2. The triangles are not similar because the angle is not the included angle for both triangles.
3. 6 A is the included angle for both triangles, so we have a pair of congruent angles. Now we have to check that the
sides around the angles are proportional.
