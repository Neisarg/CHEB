10.5 Area and Perimeter of Trapezoids

Here you'll learn how to find the area and perimeter of a trapezoid given its two bases and its height.

What if you were given a trapezoid and the size of its two bases as well as its height? How could you find the total

distance around the trapezoid and the amount of space it takes up? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to

use the formulas for the perimeter and area of a trapezoid to solve problems like this.

Area and Perimeter of Trapezoids CK-12

Guidance

A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides. The parallel sides are called the bases and we will refer

to the lengths of the bases as b1 and b2. The perpendicular distance between the parallel sides is the height of the

trapezoid. The area of a trapezoid is A = 12 h(b1 +b2) where h is always perpendicular to the bases.

Example A

Find the area of the trapezoid below.

A = 121 units2

Example B

A = (9)(38)

2

A = 171 units2

Example C

Find the perimeter and area of the trapezoid.

Even though we are not told the length of the second base, we can find it using spe√cial right triangles. Both triangles

at the ends of this trapezoid are isosceles right triangles, so the hypotenuses are 4 2 and the other legs are of length
