4.5 Third Angle Theorem

Here you'll learn the Third Angle Theorem: If two triangles have two pairs of angles that are congruent, then the

third pair of angles will be congruent.

What if you were given4FGH and4XY Z and you were told that 6 F ∼= 6 X and 6 G∼= 6 Y ? What conclusion could

you draw about 6 H and 6 Z? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to make such a conclusion.

CK-12 The Third Angle Theorem

Guidance

If two angles in one triangle are congruent to two angles in another triangle, then the third pair of angles must also

congruent. This is called the Third Angle Theorem.

If 6 A∼= 6 D and 6 B∼= 6 E, then 6 C ∼= 6 F .

Example A

Determine the measure of the missing angles.

4.5. Third Angle Theorem www.ck12.org

From the Third Angle Theorem, we know 6 C ∼= 6 F . From the Triangle Sum Theorem, we know that the sum of the

interior angles in each triangle is 180◦.

m6 A+m6 B+m 6 C = 180◦

m6 D+m6 B+m 6 C = 180◦

42◦+83◦+m 6 C = 180◦

m 6 C = 55◦ = m6 F

Example B

Explain why the Third Angle Theorem works.

The Third Angle Theorem is really like an extension of the Triangle Sum Theorem. Once you know two angles in

a triangle, you automatically know the third because of the Triangle Sum Theorem. This means that if you have

two triangles with two pairs of angles congruent between them, when you use the Triangle Sum Theorem on each

triangle to come up with the third angle you will get the same answer both times. Therefore, the third pair of angles

must also be congruent.

Example C

Determine the measure of all the angles in the triangle:

First we can see that m 6 DCA = 15◦. This means that m6 BAC = 15◦ also because they are alternate interior angles.

m6 ABC = 153◦ was given. This means by the Triangle Sum Theorem that m6 BCA= 12◦. This means that m 6 CAD=

12◦ also because they are alternate interior angles. Finally, m6 ADC = 153◦ by the Triangle Sum Theorem.

Answers:
1. m6 A = 86, m6 C = 42 and by the Triangle Sum Theorem m6 B = 52.
m6 Y = 42, m6 X = 86 and by the Triangle Sum Theorem, m 6 Z = 52.
2. m6 C = m 6 A = m6 Y = m6 Z = 35. By the Triangle Sum Theorem m6 B = m6 X = 110.
3. m6 A = 28, m6 ABE = 90 and by the Triangle Sum Theorem, m6 E = 62. m 6 D = m 6 E = 62 because they are
alternate interior angles and the lines are parallel. m6 C = m 6 A = 28 because they are alternate interior angles and
the lines are parallel. m6 DBC = m 6 ABE = 90 because they are vertical angles.
