9.6 Inscribed Quadrilaterals in Circles

Here you'll learn about inscribed quadrilaterals and how to use the Inscribed Quadrilateral Theorem to solve prob-

lems about circles.

What if you were given a circle with a quadrilateral inscribed in it? How could you use information about the

arcs formed by the quadrilateral and/or the quadrilateral's angle measures to find the measure of the unknown

quadrilateral angles? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to apply the Inscribed Quadrilateral Theorem to

solve problems like this one.

Inscribed Quadrilaterals in Circles CK-12

Guidance

An inscribed polygon is a polygon where every vertex is on the circle, as shown below.

For inscribed quadrilaterals in particular, the opposite angles will always be supplementary.

Inscribed Quadrilateral Theorem: A quadrilateral can be inscribed in a circle if and only if the opposite angles

are supplementary.

If ABCD is inscribed in E, then m6 A+m 6 C = 180⊙◦ and m6 B+m6 D = 180◦. Conversely, If m 6 A+m6 C = 180◦

and m6 B+m6 D = 180◦, then ABCD is inscribed in E.

Example A

Find the values of the missing variables.

a)

b)

Answers:

a)

x+80◦ = 180◦ y+71◦ = 180◦

x = 100◦ y = 109◦

b)

1

z+93◦ = 180◦ x = (58◦+106◦) y+82◦ = 180◦

2

z = 87◦ x = 82◦ y = 98◦

Example B

Find x and y in the picture below.

(7x+1)◦+105◦ = 180◦ (4y+14)◦+(7y+1)◦ = 180◦
7x+106◦ = 180◦ 11y+15◦ = 180◦
7x = 74 11y = 165
x = 10.57 y = 15
Example C
⊙
Find the values of x and y in A.
Use the Inscribed Quadrilateral Theorem. x◦+108◦ = 180◦ so x = 72◦. Similarly, y◦+88◦ = 180◦ so y = 92◦.

www.ck12.org Chapter 9. Circles
3. m6 C
4. m6 D
Answers:
First, note that mÂD = 105◦ because the complete circle must add up to 360◦.
1. m6 A = 12 mB̂D =
1
2(115+86) = 100.5
◦
2. m6 B = 12 mÂC =
1
2(86+105) = 95.5
◦
3. m6 C = 180◦−m6 A = 180◦−100.5◦ = 79.5◦
4. m6 D = 180◦−m6 B = 180◦−95.5◦ = 84.5◦
