2.1 Inductive Reasoning from Patterns

Here you'll learn how to inductively draw conclusions from patterns and examples to solve problems.

What if you were given a pattern of three numbers or shapes and asked to determine the sixth number or shape that

fit that pattern? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use inductive reasoning to draw conclusions like

this based on examples and patterns provided.

James Sousa: Inductive Reasoning

Guidance

One type of reasoning is inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning entails making conclusions based upon examples

and patterns. Visual patterns and number patterns provide good examples of inductive reasoning. Let's look at some

patterns to get a feel for what inductive reasoning is.

Example A

A dot pattern is shown below. How many dots would there be in the 4th figure? How many dots would be in the 6th

figure?

65

2.1. Inductive Reasoning from Patterns www.ck12.org

Draw a picture. Counting the dots, there are 4+3+2+1 = 10 dots.

For the 6th figure, we can use the same pattern, 6+5+4+3+2+1. There are 21 dots in the 6th figure.

Example B

How many triangles would be in the 10th figure?

There would be 10 squares in the 10th figure, with a triangle above and below each one. There is also a triangle on

each end of the figure. That makes 10+10+2 = 22 triangles in all.

Example C

Look at the pattern 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, . . . What is the 19th term in the pattern?

Each term is 2 more than the previous term.

You could count out the pattern until the 19th term, but that could take a while. Notice that the 1st term is 2 ·1, the

2nd term is 2 ·2, the 3rd term is 2 ·3, and so on. So, the 19th term would be 2 ·19 or 38.

Guided Practice
1. For two points, there is one line segment connecting them. For three non-collinear points, there are three segments.
For four points, how many line segments can be drawn to connect them? If you add a fifth point, how many line
segments can be drawn to connect the five points?
2. Look at the pattern 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, . . . What is the 34th term in the pattern?
3. Look at the pattern: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, . . .
a) What is the next term in the pattern?
b) What is the 10th term?
4. Find the 8th term in the list of numbers: 2, 34 ,
4
9 ,
5
16 ,
6
25 . . .
Answers:
1. Draw a picture of each and count the segments.
For 4 points there are 6 line segments and for 5 points there are 10 line segments.
2. The next term would be 13 and continue go up by 2. Comparing this pattern to Example C, each term is one less.
So, we can reason that the 34th term would be 34 ·2 minus 1, which is 67.
3. Each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.
67

Therefore, the next term will be 48·2 or 96. To find the 10th term, continue to multiply by 2, or 3·︸2  ·   2    ·   2     ·   2    · ︷2︷·   2     ·   2    ·   2    ·   2︸=

4. First, change 2 into a fraction, or 21 . So, the pattern is now
2
1 ,
3
4 ,
4
9 ,
5
16 ,
6
25 . . . The top is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. It increases by 1
each time, so the 8th term's numerator is 9. The denominators are the square numbers, so the 8th term's denominator
is 82 or 64. The 8th term is 964 .
