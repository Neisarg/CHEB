7.9 Parallel Lines and Transversals

Here you'll learn how to use the Triangle Proportionality Theorem, which states that if a line that is parallel to one

side of a triangle intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally.

What if you were looking at a map that showed four parallel streets (A, B, C, and D) cut by two avenues, or

transversals, (1 and 2)? How could you determine the distance you would have to travel down Avenue 2 to reach

Street C from Street B given the distance down Avenue 1 from Street A to Street B, the distance down Avenue 1

from Street B to C, and the distance down Avenue 2 from Street A to B? After completing this Concept, you'll be

able to solve problems like this one.

Guidance

The Triangle Proportionality Theorem states that if a line parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two

sides, then it divides those sides proportionally. We can extend this theorem to a situation outside of triangles where

we have multiple parallel lines cut by transverals.

Theorem: If two or more parallel lines are cut by two transversals, then they divide the transversals proportionally.

If l ‖ m ‖ n, then ab = cd or ac = bd .

Note that this theorem works for any number of parallel lines with any number of transversals. When this happens,

all corresponding segments of the transversals are proportional.

Example A

Find a.
