10.4 Area of Composite Shapes

Here you'll learn how to find the area of a figure that can be broken down into shapes you've already learned.

What if you drew a basic house with a triangle on top of a square? How could you find the area of this composite

shape? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to calculate the area of irregular shapes that are made up of

two or more shapes you already know.

Guidance

Perimeter is the distance around a shape. The perimeter of any figure must have a unit of measurement attached to

it. If no specific units are given (feet, inches, centimeters, etc), write "units."

Area is the amount of space inside a figure. If two figures are congruent, they have the same area ( Congruent

Areas Postulate).

A composite shape is a shape made up of other shapes. To find the area of such a shape, simply find the area of

each part and add them up.

Area Addition Postulate: If a figure is composed of two or more parts that do not overlap each other, then the area

of the figure is the sum of the areas of the parts.

Example A

Find the area of the figure below.

www.ck12.org Chapter 10. Perimeter and Area

Divide the figure into a triangle and a rectangle with a small rectangle cut out of the lower right-hand corner.

A = (Atop triang)le +Arectangl)e−Asmall tri)angle

1

A = ·6 · 19 +(9 ·15) −( ·3 ·6

2 2

A = 27+135−9

A = 153 units2

Example B

Divide the shape into two rectangles and one triangle. Find the area of the two rectangles and triangle:

Rectangle #1: Area = 24(9+12) = 504 units2

Rectangle #2: Area = 15(9+12) = 315 units2

Triangle: Area = 15(9)2 = 67.5 units

Example C
Find the area of the entire shape from Example B (you will need to subtract the area of the small triangle in the lower
right-hand corner).
Total Area = 504+315+67.5− 15(12)2 = 796.5 units2
