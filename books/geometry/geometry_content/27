3.6 Same Side Interior Angles

Here you'll learn what same side interior angles are and what relationship they have with parallel lines.

What if you were presented with two angles that are on the same side of the transversal and on the interior of

the two lines? How would you describe these angles and what could you conclude about their measures? After

completing this Concept, you'll be able to answer these questions and apply same side interior angle theorems to

find the measure of unknown angles.

Same side interior angles are two angles that are on the same side of the transversal and on the interior of the two

lines.

Same Side Interior Angles Theorem: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the same side interior

angles are supplementary.

If l||m, then m6 1+m 6 2 = 180◦.

Converse of the Same Side Interior Angles Theorem: If two lines are cut by a transversal and the same side

interior angles are supplementary, then the lines are parallel.

If

then l||m.

Example A
Find z.
z+116◦ = 180◦ so z = 64◦ by Same Side Interior Angles Theorem.
Example B
Is l||m? How do you know?
These angles are Same Side Interior Angles. So, if they add up to 180◦, then l||m.
130◦+67◦ = 197◦, therefore the lines are not parallel.
Example C
Give two examples of same side interior angles in the diagram below:
There are MANY examples of same side interior angles in the diagram. Two are 6 6 and 6 10, and 6 8 and 6 12.

Guided Practice
1. Find the value of x.
2. Find the value of y.
3. Find the value of x if m6 3 = (3x+12)◦ and m6 5 = (5x+8)◦.
Answers:
1. The given angles are same side interior angles. Because the lines are parallel, the angles add up to 180◦.
(2x+43)◦+(2x−3)◦ = 180◦
(4x+40)◦ = 180◦
4x = 140
x = 35

2. y is a same side interior angle with the marked right angle. This means that 90◦+ y = 180 so y = 90.
3. These are same side interior angles so set up an equation and solve for x. Remember that same side interior angles
add up to 180◦.
(3x+12)◦+(5x+8)◦ = 180◦
(8x+20)◦ = 180◦
8x = 160
x = 20
