2.2 Deductive Reasoning

Here you'll learn how to deductively draw conclusions from given facts.

What if you were given a fact like "If you are late for class, you will get a detention"? What conclusions could you

draw from this fact? After completing this concept, you'll be able to use deductive reasoning laws to make logical

conclusions.

James Sousa: Introduction to Deductive Reasoning

Guidance

Deductive reasoning entails drawing conclusion from facts. When using deductive reasoning there are a few laws

that are helpful to know.

Law of Detachment: If p→ q is true, and p is true, then q is true. See the example below.

Here are two true statements:

1. If a number is odd (p), then it is the sum of an even and odd number (q).

2. 5 is an odd number (a specific example of p).

The conclusion must be that 5 is the sum of an even and an odd number (q).

Law of Contrapositive: If p→ q is true and ∼ q is true, then you can conclude ∼ p. See the example below.

Here are two true statements:

1. If a student is in Geometry (p), then he or she has passed Algebra I (q).

70

2. Daniel has not passed Algebra I (a specific example of ~q).

The conclusion must be that Daniel is not in Geometry (~p).

Law of Syllogism: If p→ q and q→ r are true, then p→ r is true. See the example below.

Here are three true statements:

1. If Pete is late (p), Mark will be late (q).

2. If Mark is late (q), Karl will be late (r).

3. Pete is late (p).

Notice how each "then" becomes the next "if" in a chain of statements. If Pete is late, this starts a domino effect

of lateness. Mark will be late and Karl will be late too. So, if Pete is late, then Karl will be late (r), is the logical

conclusion.

Example A

Suppose Bea makes the following statements, which are known to be true.

If Central High School wins today, they will go to the regional tournament. Central High School won today.

What is the logical conclusion?

These are true statements that we can take as facts. The conclusion is: Central High School will go to the regional

tournament.

Example B

Here are two true statements.

If 6 A and 6 B are a linear pair, then m6 A+m6 B = 180◦.

6 ABC and 6 CBD are a linear pair.

What conclusion can you draw from this?

This is an example of the Law of Detachment, therefore:

m6 ABC+m6 CBD = 180◦

Example C

Determine the conclusion from the true statements below.

Babies wear diapers.

My little brother does not wear diapers.

The second statement is the equivalent of∼ q. Therefore, the conclusion is ∼ p, or: My little brother is not a baby.

2. Daniel has not passed Algebra I (a specific example of ~q).
The conclusion must be that Daniel is not in Geometry (~p).
Law of Syllogism: If p→ q and q→ r are true, then p→ r is true. See the example below.
Here are three true statements:
1. If Pete is late (p), Mark will be late (q).
2. If Mark is late (q), Karl will be late (r).
3. Pete is late (p).
Notice how each "then" becomes the next "if" in a chain of statements. If Pete is late, this starts a domino effect
of lateness. Mark will be late and Karl will be late too. So, if Pete is late, then Karl will be late (r), is the logical
conclusion.
Example A
Suppose Bea makes the following statements, which are known to be true.
If Central High School wins today, they will go to the regional tournament. Central High School won today.
What is the logical conclusion?
These are true statements that we can take as facts. The conclusion is: Central High School will go to the regional
tournament.

1. Here are two true statements.
If 6 A and 6 B are a linear pair, then m6 A+m6 B = 180◦.
m6 1 = 90◦ and m 6 2 = 90◦.
What conclusion can you draw from these two statements?
2. Determine the conclusion from the true statements below.
If you are not in Chicago, then you can't be on the L.
Bill is in Chicago.
3. Determine the conclusion from the true statements below.
If you are not in Chicago, then you can't be on the L.
Sally is on the L.
Answers:
1. Here there is NO conclusion. These statements are in the form:
p→ q
q
We cannot conclude that 6 1 and 6 2 are a linear pair.
Here are two counterexamples:
2. If we were to rewrite this symbolically, it would look like:
∼ p→∼ q
p
This is not in the form of the Law of Contrapositive or the Law of Detachment, so neither of these laws can be used
to draw a logical conclusion.
3. If we were to rewrite this symbolically, it would look like:

∼ p→∼ q
q
Even though it looks a little different, this is an example of the Law of Contrapositive. Therefore, the logical
conclusion is: Sally is in Chicago.

Determine the logical conclusion and state which law you used (Law of Detachment, Law of Contrapositive, or Law
of Syllogism). If no conclusion can be drawn, write "no conclusion."
1. People who vote for Jane Wannabe are smart people. I voted for Jane Wannabe.
2. If Rae is the driver today then Maria is the driver tomorrow. Ann is the driver today.
3. All equiangular triangles are equilateral. 4ABC is equiangular.
4. If North wins, then West wins. If West wins, then East loses.
5. If z > 5, then x > 3. If x > 3, then y > 7.
6. If I am cold, then I wear a jacket. I am not wearing a jacket.
7. If it is raining outside, then I need an umbrella. It is not raining outside.
8. If a shape is a circle, then it never ends. If it never ends, then it never starts. If it never starts, then it doesn't
exist. If it doesn't exist, then we don't need to study it.
9. If you text while driving, then you are unsafe. You are a safe driver.
10. If you wear sunglasses, then it is sunny outside. You are wearing sunglasses.
