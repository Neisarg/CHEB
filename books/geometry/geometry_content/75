7.12 Dilation in the Coordinate Plane

Here you'll learn how to draw dilated figures in the coordinate plane given starting coordinates and the scale factor.

You'll also learn how to use dilated figures in the coordinate plane to find scale factors.

What if you were given the coordinates of a figure and were asked to dilate that figure by a scale factor of 2? How

could you find the coordinates of the dilated figure? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to solve problems

like this one.

CK-12 Foundation: Dilation in the Coordinate Plane

Guidance

Two figures are similar if they are the same shape but not necessarily the same size. One way to create similar figures

is by dilating. A dilation makes a figure larger or smaller such that the new image has the same shape as the original.

Dilation: An enlargement or reduction of a figure that preserves shape but not size. All dilations are similar to the

original figure.

Dilations have a center and a scale factor. The center is the point of reference for the dilation and the scale factor

tells us how much the figure stretches or shrinks. A scale factor is labeled k. Only positive scale factors, k, will be

considered in this text.

If the dilated image is smaller than the original, then 0 < k < 1.

If the dilated image is larger than the original, then k > 1.

To dilate something in the coordinate plane, multiply each coordinate by the scale factor. This is called mapping.

For any dilation the mapping will be (x,y)→ (kx,ky). In this text, the center of dilation will always be the origin.

Example A

Quadrilateral EFGH has vertices E(−4,−2),F(1,4),G(6,2) and H(0,−4). Draw the dilation with a scale factor of

1.5.

Remember that to dilate something in the coordinate plane, multiply each coordinate by the scale factor.

For this dilation, the mapping will be (x,y)→ (1.5x,1.5y).

E(−4,−2)→ (1.5(−4),1.5(−2))→ E ′(−6,−3)

F(1,4)→ (1.5(1),1.5(4))→ F ′(1.5,6)

G(6,2)→ (1.5(6),1.5(2))→ G′(9,3)

H(0,−4)→ (1.5(0),1.5(−4))→ H ′(0,−6)

In the graph above, the blue quadrilateral is the original and the red image is the dilation.

Example B

Determine the coordinates of4ABC and4A′B′C′ and find the scale factor.

The coordinates of the vertices of4ABC are A(2,1), B(5,1) and C(3,6). The coordinates of the vertices of4A′B′C′

are A′(6,3),B′(15,3) and C′(9,18). Each of the corresponding coordinates are three times the original, so k = 3.

Example C
Show that dilations preserve shape by using the distance formula. Find the lengths of the sides of both triangles in
Example B.
4ABC√ 4A′B′C√ √′ √
AB = √(2−5)2 +(1−1)2 = 9 = 3 A′B′ = (6−15)2 +(3−3)2 = 81 = 9√ √ √ √
AC = √(2−3)2 +(1−6)2 = 26 A′C′ = √(6−9)2 +(3−18)2 = 234 = 3 26√
CB = (3−5)2 +(6−1)2 = 29 C′ ′
√ √
B = (9−15)2 +(18−3)2 = 261 = 3 29
From this, we also see that all the sides of4A′B′C′ are three times larger than4ABC.
