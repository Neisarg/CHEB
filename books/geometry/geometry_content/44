4.11 Equilateral Triangles

Here you'll learn the definition of an equilateral triangle as well as an important theorem about equilateral triangles:

Equilateral triangles are always equiangular.

What if you were presented with an equilateral triangle and told that its sides measure x, y, and 8? What could you

conclude about x and y? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to apply important properties about equilateral

triangles to help you solve problems like this one.

James Sousa: Using the Properties of Equilateral Triangles

Guidance

All sides in an equilateral triangle have the same length. One important property of equilateral triangles is that

all of their angles are congruent (and thus 60◦ each). This is called the Equilateral Triangle Theorem and can be

derived from the Base Angles Theorem.

Equilateral Triangle Theorem: All equilateral triangles are also equiangular. Furthermore, all equiangular trian-

gles are also equilateral.

If AB∼= BC ∼= AC, then 6 A∼= 6 B∼= 6 C. Conversely, if 6 A∼= 6 B∼= 6 C, then AB∼= BC ∼= AC.

Example A

Find the value of x.

Solution: Because this is an equilateral triangle 3x−1 = 11. Solve for x.

3x−1 = 11

3x = 12

x = 4

Example B

Find the values of x and y.

The markings show that this is an equilateral triangle since all sides are congruent. This means all sides must equal
10. We have x = 10 and y+3 = 10 which means that y = 7.
Example C
Two sides of an equilateral triangle are 2x+5 units and x+13 units. How long is each side of this triangle?
The two given sides must be equal because this is an equilateral triangle. Write and solve the equation for x.
2x+5 = x+13
x = 8
To figure out how long each side is, plug in 8 for x in either of the original expressions. 2(8)+5 = 21. Each side is
21 units.

3. True or false: All equilateral triangles are isosceles triangles.
Answers:
1. The markings show that all angles are congruent. Since all three angles must add up to 180◦ this means that each
angle must equal 60◦. Write and solve an equation:
8y+4 = 60
8y = 56
y = 7

3. This statement is true. The definition of an isosceles triangle is a triangle with at least two congruent sides. Since
all equilateral triangles have three congruent sides, they fit the definition of an isosceles triangle.

Summary
This chapter begins by showing that the sum of the angles in a triangle is a constant. From the Triangle Sum Theorem,
theorems related to the exterior angles of a triangle are developed. The definition of congruency is presented and
from that foundation the chapter presents other important theorems related to congruent triangles, such as the Third
Angle Theorem and the SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS and HL Triangle Congruency Theorems. Isosceles triangles and
equilateral triangles are compared and explored.
