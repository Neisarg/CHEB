8.4 Inscribed Similar Triangles

Here you'll learn the Inscribed Similar Triangles Theorem that states that a line drawn from the right angle of a right

triangle perpendicular to the opposite side of the triangle creates similar triangles. You'll then use this fact to find

missing lengths in right triangles.

What if you drew a line from the right angle of a right triangle perpendicular to the side that is opposite that angle?

How could you determine the length of that line? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to solve problems

like this one.

Guidance

Remember that if two objects are similar, their corresponding angles are congruent and their sides are proportional

in length. The altitude of a right triangle creates similar triangles.

Inscribed Similar Triangles Theorem: If an altitude is drawn from the right angle of any right triangle, then the

two triangles formed are similar to the original triangle and all three triangles are similar to each other.

In4ADB,m6 A = 90◦ and AC⊥DB:

So,4ADB∼4CDA∼4CAB:

This means that all of the corresponding sides are proportional. You can use this fact to find missing lengths in right

triangles.

Set up a proportion for y. Or, now that you know the value of x you can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for y.
Use the method you feel most comfortable with.
