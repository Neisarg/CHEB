8.2 Pythagorean Theorem and Pythagorean

Triples

Here you'll learn how to use the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that given a right triangle with legs of lengths

a and b and a hypotenuse of length c, a2 +b2 = c2. You'll also learn the theorem's converse and what a Pythagorean

Triple is.

What if you were told that a triangle had side lengths of 5, 12, and 13? How could you determine if the triangle were

a right one? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve problems like

this one.

James Sousa: Pythagorean Theorem

Guidance

The two shorter sides of a right triangle (the sides that form the right angle) are the legs and the longer side (the

side opposite the right angle) is the hypotenuse. For the Pythagorean Theorem, the legs are "a" and "b" and the

hypotenuse is "c".

Pythagorean Theorem: Given a right triangle with legs of lengths a and b and a hypotenuse of length c, a2+b2 = c2.

For proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem go to: http://www.mathsisfun.com/pythagoras.html and scroll down to "And

You Can Prove the Theorem Yourself."

The converse of the Pythagorean Theorem is also true. It allows you to prove that a triangle is a right triangle even

if you do not know its angle measures.

Pythagorean Theorem Converse: If the square of the longest side of a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares

of the other two sides, then the triangle is a right triangle.

If a2 +b2 = c2, then4ABC is a right triangle.

Pythagorean Triples

A combination of three numbers that makes the Pythagorean Theorem true is called a Pythagorean triple. Each set

of numbers below is a Pythagorean triple.

3,4,5 5,12,13 7,24,25 8,15,17 9,12,15 10,24,26

Any multiple of a Pythagorean triple is also considered a Pythagorean triple. Multiplying 3, 4, 5 by 2 gives 6, 8,

10, which is another triple. To see if a set of numbers makes a Pythagorean triple, plug them into the Pythagorean

Theorem.

Example A

Do 6, 7, and 8 make the sides of a right triangle?

Plug the three numbers into the Pythagorean Theorem. Remember that the largest length will always be the

hypotenuse, c. If 62 +72 = 82, then they are the sides of a right triangle.

62 +72 = 36+49 = 85

82 = 64 85 6= 64, so the lengths are not the sides of a right triangle.

Example B
Find the length of the hypotenuse.
Use the Pythagorean Theorem. Set a = 8 and b = 15. Solve for c.
82 +152 = c2
64+225 = c2
289 = c2 Take the square root o f both sides.
17 = c
Example C
Is 20, 21, 29 a Pythagorean triple?
If 202 +212 = 292, then the set is a Pythagorean triple.
202 +212 = 400+441 = 841
292 = 841
Therefore, 20, 21, and 29 is a Pythagorean triple.

2. What is the diagonal of a rectangle with sides 10 and 16?
3. D√o the√following lengths make a right triangle?
a) 5,√3, 14
b) 6,√2 3,√8 √
c) 3 2,4 2,5 2
Answers:
1. Here, we are given the hypotenuse and a leg. Let's solve for b.
72 +b2 = 142
49+b2 = 196
b2 = 1√47 √ √
b = 147 = 49 ·3 = 7 3
2. For any square and rectangle, you can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of a diagonal. Plug in the
sides to find d.
102 +162 = d2
100+256 = d2
356 = d2√ √
d = 356 = 2 89≈ 18.87
3. Even though there is no picture, you can still use the Pythagorean Theorem. Again, the longest length will be c.
a) (√ )2 √ 2
5 +32 = 14
5+9 = 14
Yes
b) ( √ )2
62 + 2 3 = 82
36+(4 ·3) = 64
36+12 6= 64
√
c) This is a multiple of 2 of a 3, 4, 5 right triangle. Yes, this is a right triangle.
