5.5 Altitudes

Here you'll learn the definition of altitude and how to determine where a triangle's altitude will be found.

What if you were given one or more of a triangle's angle measures? How would you determine where the triangle's

altitude would be found? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to answer this type of question.

James Sousa: Altitudes of a Triangle

Guidance

In a triangle, a line segment from a vertex and perpendicular to the opposite side is called an altitude. It is also

called the height of a triangle. The red lines below are all altitudes.

When a triangle is a right triangle, the altitude, or height, is the leg. If the triangle is obtuse, then the altitude will be

outside of the triangle. If the triangle is acute, then the altitude will be inside the triangle.

Example A

Which line segment is the altitude of4ABC?

In a right triangle, the altitude, or the height, is the leg. If we rotate the triangle so that the right angle is in the lower

left corner, we see that leg BC is the altitude.

Example B

A triangle has angles that measure 55◦,60◦, and 65◦. Where will the altitude be found?

Because all of the angle measures are less than 90◦, the triangle is an acute triangle. The altitude of any acute triangle

is inside the triangle.

Example C

A triangle has an angle that measures 95◦. Where will an altitude be found?

Because 95◦ > 90◦, the triangle is obtuse and it will be outside the triangle.

Answers
1. Every triangle has three altitudes. For an obtuse triangle, at least one of the altitudes will be outside of the triangle,
as shown in the picture at the beginning of this concept.
2. The triangle is an acute triangle, so the altitude is inside the triangle as shown below so that it is perpendicular to
the base.
3. The triangle is a right triangle, so the altitude is already drawn. The altitude is XZ.
