2.4 Converse, Inverse, and Contrapositive

Here you'll learn how to write the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of any conditional statement. You'll also

learn what a biconditional statement is.

What if you were given a conditional statement like "If I walk to school, then I will be late"? How could you

rearrange and/or negate this statement to form new conditional statements? After completing this Concept, you'll be

able to write the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of a conditional statement like this one.

James Sousa: Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse of an If-Then Statement

Guidance

Consider the statement: If the weather is nice, then I'll wash the car. We can rewrite this statement using letters to

represent the hypothesis and conclusion.

p = the weather is nice q = I'll wash the car

Now the statement is: If p, then q, which can also be written as p→ q.

We can also make the negations, or "nots," of p and q. The symbolic version of "not p" is ∼ p.

∼ p = the weather is not nice ∼ q = I won't wash the car

Using these "nots" and switching the order of p and q, we can create three new statements.

∼q ∼p

If the "if-then" statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the

original statement. The converse and inverse may or may not be true. When the original statement and converse are

both true then the statement is a biconditional statement. In other words, if p→ q is true and q→ p is true, then

p↔ q (said "p if and only if q").

Example A

If n > 2, then n2 > 4.

a) Find the converse, inverse, and contrapositive.

b) Determine if the statements from part a are true or false. If they are false, find a counterexample.

The original statement is true.

Converse : If n2 > 4, then n > 2.

False. If n2 = 9,n =−3 or 3. (−3)2 = 9

Inverse : If n≤ 2, then n2 ≤ 4.

False. If n =−3, then n2 = 9.

Contrapositive : If n2 ≤ 4, then n≤ 2. √ √

True. The only n2 ≤ 4 is 1 or 4. 1 =±1 and 4 =±2, which are both less than or equal to 2.

Example B

If I am at Disneyland, then I am in California.

a) Find the converse, inverse, and contrapositive.

b) Determine if the statements from part a are true or false. If they are false, find a counterexample.

The original statement is true.

Converse : If I am in California, then I am at Disneyland.

False. I could be in San Francisco.

Inverse : If I am not at Disneyland, then I am not in California.

False. Again, I could be in San Francisco.

Contrapositive : If I am not in California, then I am not at Disneyland.

True. If I am not in the state, I couldn't be at Disneyland.

Notice for the converse and inverse we can use the same counterexample.

Example C
Rewrite as a biconditional statement: Any two points are collinear.
This statement can be rewritten as:
Two points are on the same line if and only if they are collinear. Replace the "if-then" with "if and only if" in the
middle of the statement.

1. First, change the statement into an "if-then" statement:
If two points are on the same line, then they are collinear.
Converse : If two points are collinear, then they are on the same line. True.
Inverse : If two points are not on the same line, then they are not collinear. True.
Contrapositive : If two points are not collinear, then they do not lie on the same line. True.
2. Statement 1: If m 6 ABC > 90◦, then 6 ABC is an obtuse angle.
Statement 2: If 6 ABC is an obtuse angle, then m6 ABC > 90◦.
