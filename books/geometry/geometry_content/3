1.3 Congruent Angles and Angle Bisectors

Here you'll learn how to find unknown values using the definitions of angle congruency and angle bisector.

What if you were told that a line segment divides an angle in half? How would you find the measures of the two

new angles formed by that segment? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the definitions of angle

congruency and angle bisector to find such angle measures.

James Sousa: Angle Bisector Exercise2

Guidance

When two geometric figures have the same shape and size (or the same angle measure in the case of angles) they are

said to be congruent.

TABLE 1.6:

Label It Say It

6 ABC ∼= 6 DEF Angle ABC is congruent to angle DEF .

If two angles are congruent, then they are also equal. To label equal angles we use angle markings, as shown below:

An angle bisector is a line, or a portion of a line, that divides an angle into two congruent angles, each having a

measure exactly half of the original angle. Every angle has exactly one angle bisector.

In the picture above, BD is the angle bisector of 6 ABC, so 6 ABD∼= 6 DBC and m6 ABD = 12 m6 ABC.

Example A

Write all equal angle statements.

m 6 ADB = m 6 BDC = m6 FDE = 45◦

m6 ADF = m 6 ADC = 90◦

Example B
What is the measure of each angle?
From the picture, we see that the angles are equal.
Set the angles equal to each other and solve.
(5x+7)◦ = (3x+23)◦
(2x)◦ = 16◦
x = 8
To find the measure of 6 ABC, plug in x = 8 to
(5x+7)◦→ (5(8)+7)◦ = (40+7)◦ = 47◦.
Because m6 ABC = m 6 XY Z, m6 XY Z = 47◦ too.
Example C
Is OP the angle bisector of 6 SOT ?
Yes, OP is the angle bisector of 6 SOT from the markings in the picture.

Guided Practice
For exercises 1 and 2, copy the figure below and label it with the following information:
1. 6 A∼= 6 C
2. 6 B∼= 6 D
3. Use algebra to determine the value of d:
Answers:
1. You should have corresponding markings on 6 A and 6 C.
2. You should have corresponding markings on 6 B and 6 D (that look different from the markings you made in #1).
3. The square marking means it is a 90◦ angle, so the two angles are congruent. Set up an equation and solve:
7d−1 = 2d +14
5d = 15
d = 3
