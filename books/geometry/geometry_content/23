3.2 Perpendicular Lines

Here you'll learn what perpendicular lines are and how to apply some basic properties and theorems about such

lines.

What if you were given a pair of lines that intersect each other at a 90◦ angle? What terminology would you use to

describe such lines? After completing this Concept, you will be able to define perpendicular lines. You'll also be

able to apply the properties associated with such lines to solve for unknown angles.

James Sousa: Perpendicular Line Postulate

Guidance

Two lines are perpendicular when they intersect to form a 90◦ angle. Below, l ⊥ AB.

3.2. Perpendicular Lines www.ck12.org

In the definition of perpendicular the word "line" is used. However, line segments, rays and planes can also be

perpendicular. The image below shows two parallel planes, with a third blue plane that is perpendicular to both of

them.

Basic Facts about Perpendicular Lines

Theorem #1: If l||m and n⊥ l, then n⊥ m.

Theorem #2: If l ⊥ n and n⊥ m, then l||m.

Postulate: For any line and a point not on the line, there is one line perpendicular to this line passing through the

point. There are infinitely many lines that pass through A, but only one that is perpendicular to l.

Example A
Which of the following is the best example of perpendicular lines?
1. Latitude on a Globe
2. Opposite Sides of a Picture Frame
3. Fence Posts
4. Adjacent Sides of a Picture Frame
The best example would be adjacent sides of a picture frame. Remember that adjacent means next to and sharing a
vertex. The adjacent sides of a picture frame meet at a 90◦ angle and so these sides are perpendicular.
Example B
←→
I SO ⊥−→s GD?
6 OGD∼= 6 SGD and the angles form a linear pair. This means both angles are 90◦, so the lines are perpendicular.
Example C
Write a 2-column proof to prove Theorem #1. Note: You need to understand corresponding angles in order to
understand this proof. If you have not yet learned corresponding angles, be sure to check out that concept first, or
skip this example for now.

2. Determine the measure of 6 1.

www.ck12.org Chapter 3. Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
3. Find m6 1.
Answers:
1. These two angles form a linear pair and 6 STC is a right angle.
m6 STC = 90◦
m6 CTA is 180◦−90◦ = 90◦
2. We know that both parallel lines are perpendicular to the transversal.
m6 1 = 90◦.
3. The two adjacent angles add up to 90◦, so l ⊥ m.
m6 1 = 90◦
because it is a vertical angle to the pair of adjacent angles and vertical angles are congruent.
