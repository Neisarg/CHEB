7.4 AA Similarity

Here you'll learn how to determine if triangles are similar using Angle-Angle (AA).

What if you were given a pair of triangles and the angle measures for two of their angles? How could you use this

information to determine if the two triangles are similar? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the

AA Similarity Postulate to decide if two triangles are similar.

By definition, two triangles are similar if all their corresponding angles are congruent and their corresponding sides

are proportional. It is not necessary to check all angles and sides in order to tell if two triangles are similar. In fact,

if you only know that two pairs of corresponding angles are congruent that is enough information to know that the

triangles are similar. This is called the AA Similarity Postulate.

AA Similarity Postulate: If two angles in one triangle are congruent to two angles in another triangle, then the two

triangles are similar.

If 6 A∼= 6 Y and 6 B∼= 6 Z, then4ABC ∼4Y ZX .

Example A

Determine if the following two triangles are similar. If so, write the similarity statement.

Compare the angles to see if we can use the AA Similarity Postulate. Using the Triangle Sum Theorem, m6 G = 48◦

and m6 M = 30◦ So, 6 F ∼= 6 M, 6 E ∼= 6 L and 6 G∼= 6 N and the triangles are similar. 4FEG∼4MLN.

Example B

Determine if the following two triangles are similar. If so, write the similarity statement.

Compare the angles to see if we can use the AA Similarity Postulate. Using the Triangle Sum Theorem, m 6 C = 39◦

and m6 F = 59◦. m6 C 6= m6 F , So4ABC and4DEF are not similar.

When two triangles are similar, the corresponding sides are proportional. But, what are the corresponding sides?
Using the triangles from this example, we see how the sides line up in the diagram to the right.

2. Are the triangles similar? If so, write a similarity statement.
3. Are the triangles similar? If so, write a similarity statement.
Answers:
1. Because AE‖CD, 6 A ∼= 6 D and 6 C ∼= 6 E by the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem. By the AA Similarity
Postulate,4ABE ∼4DBC.
2. Yes, there are three similar triangles that each have a right angle. DGE ∼ FGD∼ FDE.
3. By the reflexive property, 6 H ∼= 6 H. Because the horizontal lines are parallel, 6 L ∼= 6 K (corresponding angles).
So yes, there is a pair of similar triangles. HLI ∼ HKJ.
