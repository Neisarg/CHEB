6.7 Kites

Here you'll learn what a kite is and what properties it possesses.

What if you were told that WIND is a kite and you are given information about some of its angles or its diagonals?

How would you find the measure of its other angles or its sides? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to

find the value of a kite's unknown angles and sides.

A kite is a quadrilateral with two distinct sets of adjacent congruent sides. It looks like a kite that flies in the air.

From the definition, a kite could be concave. If a kite is concave, it is called a dart. The word distinct in the

definition means that the two pairs of congruent sides have to be different. This means that a square or a rhombus is

not a kite.

The angles between the congruent sides are called vertex angles. The other angles are called non-vertex angles. If

we draw the diagonal through the vertex angles, we would have two congruent triangles.

Facts about Kites

1) The non-vertex angles of a kite are congruent.

If KIT E is a kite, then 6 K ∼= 6 T .

2) The diagonal through the vertex angles is the angle bisector for both angles.

If KIT E is a kite, then 6 KEI ∼= 6 IET and 6 KIE ∼= 6 EIT .

3) Kite Diagonals Theorem: The diagonals of a kite are perpendicular.

4KET and4KIT are isosceles triangles, so EI is the perpendicular bisector of KT (Isosceles Triangle Theorem).

Answer:
a) The two angles left are the non-vertex angles, which are congruent.
130◦+60◦+ x+ x = 360◦
2x = 170◦
x = 85◦ Both angles are 85◦.
b) The other non-vertex angle is also 94◦. To find the fourth angle, subtract the other three angles from 360◦.
90◦+94◦+94◦+ x = 360◦
x = 82◦
Example B
Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the lengths of the sides of the kite.
Recall that the Pythagorean Theorem says a2 + b2 = c2, where c is the hypotenuse. In this kite, the sides are the
hypotenuses.

Find:
1. m6 KIS
2. m6 IST
3. m6 SIT
Answers:
1. m6 KIS = 25◦ by the Triangle Sum Theorem (remember that 6 KSI is a right angle because the diagonals are
perpendicular.)
2. m6 IST = 90◦ because the diagonals are perpendicular.
3. m6 SIT = 25◦ because it is congruent to 6 KIS.
