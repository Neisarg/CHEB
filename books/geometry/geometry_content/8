1.8 Supplementary Angles

Here you'll learn what supplementary angles are and how to solve supplementary angle problems.

What if you were given two angles of unknown size and were told they are supplementary? How would you

determine their angle measures? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the definition of supplementary

angles to solve problems like this one.

Guidance

Two angles are supplementary if they add up to 180◦. Supplementary angles do not have to be congruent or

adjacent.

Example A

The two angles below are supplementary. If m6 MNO = 78◦ what is m6 PQR?

Set up an equation. However, instead of equaling 90◦, now the sum is 180◦.

78◦+m 6 PQR = 180◦

m 6 PQR = 102◦

Example B

What are the measures of two congruent, supplementary angles?

Supplementary angles add up to 180◦. Congruent angles have the same measure. So, 180◦÷2 = 90◦, which means

two congruent, supplementary angles are right angles, or 90◦.

Example C

Find the measure of an angle that is a supplementary to 6 MRS if m6 MRS is 70◦.

Because supplementary angles have to add up to 180◦, the other angle must be 180◦−70◦ = 110◦.

Guided Practice

Find the measure of an angle that is supplementary to 6 ABC if m6 ABC is:

1. 45◦

2. 118◦

3. 32◦

4. 2◦

Answers:

1. 180◦−45◦ = 135◦.

2. 180◦−118◦ = 62◦.

3. 180◦−32◦ = 148◦.

4. 180◦−2◦ = 178◦.
