9.8 Angles Outside a Circle

Here you'll learn how to use the Outside Angle Theorem to solve problems containing angles that are outside a

circle.

What if you were given a circle with either two secents, two tangents, or one of each that share a common point

outside the circle? How could you use the measure of the arcs formed by those circle parts to find the measure of

the angle they make outside the circle? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to apply the Outside Angle

Theorem to solve problems like this one.

Guidance

An angle is outside a circle if its vertex is outside the circle and its sides are tangents or secants. The possibilities are:

an angle formed by two tangents, an angle formed by a tangent and a secant, and an angle formed by two secants.

Outside Angle Theorem: The measure of an angle formed by two secants, two tangents, or a secant and a tangent

from a point outside the circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

Example B

Find the value of x.

x = 120

◦−32◦

Example C

Find the value of x.

First note that the missing arc by angle x measures 32◦ because the complete circle must make 360◦. Then, x =

141◦−32◦

2 =

109◦

2 = 54.5

Answers:
For all of the above problems we can use the Outside Angle Theorem.
1. x = 125
◦−27◦
2 =
98◦
2 = 49
◦
2. 40◦ is not the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is 120◦, (360◦−200◦−40◦). x = 200◦−120◦2 = 80
◦
2 = 40
◦
3. Find the other intercepted arc, 360◦−265◦ = 95◦x = 265◦−95◦2 = 170

2 = 85
