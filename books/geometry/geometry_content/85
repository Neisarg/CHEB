8.8 Trigonometric Ratios with a Calculator

Here you'll learn how to solve for missing sides in right triangles that are not one of the special right triangles.

What if you were given a 20-70-90 triangle? How could you find the sine, cosine, and tangent of the 20◦ and 70◦

angles? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use a calculator to find the trigonometric ratios for angles

that do not measure 45◦, 30◦, or 60◦.

James Sousa: Determining Trigonometric Function Values on the Calculator

Guidance

There is a fixed sine, cosine, and tangent value for every angle, from 0◦ to 90◦. Your scientific (or graphing)

calculator knows all the trigonometric values for any angle. Your calculator, should have [SIN], [COS], and [TAN]

buttons. You can use your calculator and the trigonometric ratios is to find the missing sides of a right triangle by

setting up a trig equation.

Example A

Find the trigonometric value, using your calculator. Round to 4 decimal places.

a) sin78◦

b) cos60◦

c) tan15◦

Depending on your calculator, you enter the degree and then press the trig button or the other way around. Also,

make sure the mode of your calculator is in DEGREES.

a) sin78◦ = 0.97815

b) cos60◦ = 0.5

c) tan15◦ = 0.26795

Example B

Find the value of each variable. Round your answer to the nearest tenth.

We are given the hypotenuse. Use sine to find b, and cosine to find a. Use your calculator to evaluate the sine and

cosine of the angles.

b≈ 11.2 a≈ 27.8

Example C

Find the value of each variable. Round your answer to the nearest tenth.

We are given the adjacent leg to 42◦. To find c, use cosine and use tangent to find d.
