9.2 Tangent Lines

Here you'll learn two theorems about tangent lines: 1) the Tangent to a Circle Theorem that states tangents are

perpendicular to radii; and 2) the Two Tangents Theorem that states two tangents drawn from the same point will be

congruent.

What if a line were drawn outside a circle that appeared to touch the circle at only one point? How could you

determine if that line were actually a tangent? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to apply theorems to

solve tangent problems like this one.

There are two important theorems about tangent lines.

470

www.ck12.org Chapter 9. Circles

1) Tangent to a Circle Theorem: A line is tangent to a circle if and only if the line is perpendicular to the radius

drawn to the point of tangency.

←→ ←→

BC is tangent at point B if and only if BC ⊥ AB.

This theorem uses the words "if and only if," making it a biconditional statement, which means the converse of this

theorem is also true.

2) Two Tangents Theorem: If two tangent segments are drawn to one circle from the same external point, then they

are congruent.

BC and DC have C as an endpoint and are tangent; BC ∼= DC.

Example A

⊙

CB is tangent to A at point B. Find AC. Reduce any radicals.

CB is tangent, so AB⊥CB and4ABC a right triangle. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find AC.

52 +82 = AC2

25+64 = AC2

89 = AC2√

AC = 89

1) Tangent to a Circle Theorem: A line is tangent to a circle if and only if the line is perpendicular to the radius
drawn to the point of tangency.

Example B
⊙
Using the answer from Example A above, find DC in A. Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.
DC = A√C−AD
DC = 89−5≈ 4.43
Example C
Find the perimeter of4ABC.
A⊙E = AD, EB = BF, and CF =CD. Therefore, the perimeter of4ABC = 6+6+4+4+7+7 = 34.
G is inscribed in4ABC. A circle is inscribed in a polygon if every side of the polygon is tangent to the circle.

1. Find AB between A and B. Reduce the radical.

2. Determine if the triangle below is a right triangle.
3. If D and C are the centers and AE is tangent to both circles, find DC.
4. Find the value of x.
Answers:
1. AD⊥ DC and DC ⊥CB. Draw in BE, so EDCB is a rectangle. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find AB.
52 +552 = AB2
25+3025 = AB2
3050 = AB2√ √
AB = 3050 = 5 122

2. Again, use the Pythagorean Theorem. 4 10 is the longest side, so it will be c.
Does ( √ )2
82 +102 = 4 10 ?
64+100 6= 160
4 ⊙ABC is not a right triangle. From this, we also find that CB is not tangent to A.
3. AE ⊥ DE and AE ⊥ AC and4ABC ∼4DBE by AA Similarity.
To find DB, use the Pythagorean Theorem.
102 +242 = DB2
100+576 = 6√76
DB = 676 = 26
To find BC, use similar triangles. 510 =
BC
26 −→ BC = 13. DC = DB+BC = 26+13 = 39
4. AB∼=CB by the Two Tangents Theorem. Set AB =CB and solve for x.
4x−9 = 15
4x = 24
x = 6
