12.1 Reflection Symmetry

Here you'll learn what reflection symmetry is and how to find lines of symmetry for a figure.

What if you had a six-pointed star, you drew a line down it, and then you folded it along that line? If the two sides

of the star lined up, what would that mean about the line? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to draw the

lines of symmetry for a figure like this one.

Guidance

A line of symmetry is a line that passes through a figure such that it splits the figure into two congruent halves such

that if one half were folded across the line of symmetry it would land directly on top of the other half.

Reflection symmetry is present when a figure has one or more lines of symmetry. These figures have reflection

symmetry:

These figures do not have reflection symmetry:

Answers:
For each figure, draw lines through the figure so that the lines perfectly cut the figure in half. Figure 1 has eight, 2
has no lines of symmetry, and 3 has one.
