3.7 Slope in the Coordinate Plane

Here you'll learn how to find the slope of a line given two of its points and you'll review the different types of slope.

What if you were given the coordinates of two points? How would you determine the steepness of the line they

form? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to find the slope of a line through two points.

CK-12 Slope in the Coordinate Plane

Guidance

Recall from Algebra I that slope is the measure of the steepness of a line. Two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) have a

slope of m = (y2−y1)(x2−x1) . You might have also learned slope as

rise

run . This is a great way to remember the formula. Also

remember that if an equation is written in slope-intercept form, y = mx+b, then m is always the slope of the line.

Slopes can be positive, negative, zero, or undefined as shown in the pictures below:

Positive:

Negative:

Example C
The picture shown is the California Incline, a short road that connects Highway 1 with Santa Monica. The length of
the road is 1532 feet and has an elevation of 177 feet. You may assume that the base of this incline is zero feet. Can
you find the slope of the California Incline?

In order to find the slope, we need to first find the horizontal distance in the triangle shown. This triangle represents
the incline and the elevation. To find the horizontal distance, we need to use the Pythagorean Theorem (a concept
you will be introduced to formally in a future lesson), a2 +b2 = c2, where c is the hypotenuse.
1772 + run2 = 15322
31,329+ run2 = 2,347,024
run2 = 2,315,695
run≈ 1521.75
The slope is then 1771521.75 , which is roughly

2. What is the slope of the line through (3, 2) and (3, 6)?
3. Find the slope between (-5, 2) and (3, 4).
Answers:
1. Use (-5, -1) as (x1,y1) and (3, -1) as (x2,y2).
−1− (−1) 0
m = =
3− (− = 05) 8
The slope of this line is 0, or a horizontal line. Horizontal lines always pass through the y−axis. The y−coordinate
for both points is -1. So, the equation of this line is y =−1.
2. Use (3, 2) as (x1,y1) and (3, 6) as (x2,y2).
6−2 4
m = = u d f n d
3− = n e i e3 0
The slope of this line is undefined, which means that it is a vertical line. Vertical lines always pass through the
x−axis. The x−coordinate for both points is 3.
So, the equation of this line is x = 3.
3. Use (-5, 2) as (x1,y1) and (3, 4) as (x2,y2).
