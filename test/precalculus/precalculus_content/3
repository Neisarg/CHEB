A variable is a letter that can represent any number from a given set of numbers. If we
start with variables, such as x, y, and z and some real numbers, and combine them using
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers, and roots, we obtain an algebraic
expression. Here are some examples:
2x2
y # 2z
# 3x $ 4   1x $ 10   
y2 $ 4
A monomial is an expression of the form axk, where a is a real number and k is a non-
negative integer. A binomial is a sum of two monomials and a trinomial is a sum of three
monomials. In general, a sum of monomials is called a polynomial. For example, the first
expression listed above is a polynomial, but the other two are not.
POLYNOMIALS
A polynomial in the variable x is an expression of the form
a nx
n
 $ a n#1 . . .
 n#1x $ $ a1x $ a0
where a0, a1, . . . , an are real numbers, and n is a nonnegative integer. If an " 0,
then the polynomial has degree n. The monomials a kxk that make up the poly-
nomial are called the terms of the polynomial.
Note that the degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable that appears
in the polynomial.
