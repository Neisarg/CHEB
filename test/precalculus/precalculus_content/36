The Unit Circle ! Terminal Points on the Unit Curcle ! The Reference Number
In this section we explore some properties of the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin.
These properties are used in the next section to define the trigonometric functions.
! The Unit Circle
y The set of points at a distance 1 from the origin is a circle of radius 1 (see Figure 1). In
Section 1.8 we learned that the equation of this circle is x2 ! y2 " 1.
