and Rectangular Coordinates ! Polar Equations

r to rectangular coordinates.

! Definition of Polar Coordinates
Polar axis The polar coordinate system uses distances and directions to specify the location of a
point in the plane. To set up this system, we choose a fixed point O in the plane called the
F I G U R E  1 pole (or origin) and draw from O a ray (half-line) called the polar axis as in Figure 1.
Then each point P can be assigned polar coordinates P1r,  u 2 where
r is the distance from O to P
u is the angle between the polar axis and the segment OP
O ¨ We use the convention that u is positive if measured in a counterclockwise direction from
| r | the polar axis or negative if measur0ed r 0 in a clockwise direction. If r is negative, then P1r,  u 2is defined to be the point that lies units from the pole in the direction opposite to that
P(r, )¨ given by u (see Figure 2).
