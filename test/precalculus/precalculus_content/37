P(x, y) distance t along the unit circle, starting at the po2int 11, 0 2 . We move in a counterclockwiset direction if t is positive and in a clockwise direction if t is negative (see Figure 1). We nowuse the x- and y-coordinates of the point

! Values of the Trigonometric Functions
To compute other values of the trigonometric functions, we first determine their signs. The
signs of the trigonometric functions depend on the quadrant in which the terminal point
of t lies. For example, if the terminal point P1x, y 2 determined by t lies in Quadrant III,

For example cos12p/3 2 & 0 because the terminal point of t " 2p/3 is in Quadrant II,
whereas tan 4 % 0 because the terminal point of t " 4 is in Quadrant III.
In Section 5.1 we used the reference number to find the terminal point determined by
a real number t. Since the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of the 
coordinates of terminal points, we can use the reference number to find values of the
trigonometric functions. Suppose that t is the reference number for t. Then the terminal
point of t has the same coordinates, except possibly for sign, as the terminal point of t. So
the values of the trigonometric functions at t are the same, except possibly for sign, as
their values at t . We illustrate this procedure in the next example.
