Compounded Interest
Any positive number can be used as a base for an exponential function. In this section we
study the special base e, which is convenient for applications involving calculus. 
! The Number e
The number e is defined as the value that 11 & 1/n 2 n approaches as n becomes large. (In
calculus this idea is made more precise through the concept of a limit. See Chapter 13.) The
table shows the values of the expression 11 & 1/n 2 n for increasingly large values of n.

because it is optimal for distributing the

poles) hang in the shape of a catenary.
It can be shown that e is an irrational number, so we cannot write its exact value in deci-
mal form.
! The Natural Exponential Function

because it is the first letter of the word with. We will see, however, that in certain applications the number e is the best possible
