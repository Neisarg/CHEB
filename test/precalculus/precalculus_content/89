! Mathematical Induction
Let's consider a special kind of proof called mathematical induction. Here is how it
works: Suppose we have a statement that says something about all natural numbers n. For
example, for any natu
P1raln 2 number n, let P1n 2 be the following statement:: The sum of the first n odd numbers is n2
Since this statement is about all natural numbers, it contains infinitely many statements;
we will call them P(1), P(2), . . . .
 P11 2 : The sum of the first 1 odd number is 12.
 P1
 P12 23 2 : The sum of the first 2 odd numbers is 22.: The sum of the first 3 odd numbers is 32.
. .
. .
. .
How can we prove all of these statements at once? Mathematical induction is a clever way
of doing just that.
The crux of the idea is this: Suppose we can prove that whenever one of these state-
ments is true, then the one following it in the list is als
For every k, if P1k 2  is true, then P1o true.k # 1 2 In other words, is true.
This is called the induction step because it leads us from the truth of one statement to the
truth of the next. Now suppose that we c
P1an1 2  also prove that is true.
The induction step now leads us
P 1 2  is true, so P12 2  is true
P11
 through the following chain of statements:
2 2 . is true, so P13 2  is true
P13 2  is true, so P14 2 . is true.

So we see that if both the induction step and P11 2 are proved, then statement P1n 2 is
proved for all n. Here is a summary of this important method of proof.
PRINCIPLE OF MATHEMATIC AL INDUCTION
For each natural number n, let P1n 2 be a statement depending on n. Suppose that
the fo
P1 ll1 2owing two conditions are satisfied.1. is true.
2. For e
P1ve P kn 2 ry natural number k, if 1 2 is true then P1k # 1 2 is true.Then is true for all natural numbers n.
To apply this principle, there are two steps:
Step 1 Prove that P11 2 is true.
Step 2 Assume that P1k 2 is true, and use this assu2mption to prove that P1k # 1 2 is true.Notice th
P1at in S P kk # 1 2tep 2 we do not prove that 1k is trP1ue P 2k 2 . We only show that if 1 istrue, then is also true. The assumption that is true is called the induction
hypothesis.
We now use mathematical induction to prove that the conjecture that we made at the
beginning of this section is true.

which is of course true.
Step 2 We assume that is true. Thus our induction hypothesis is

is true, that is,
k # 1 2 " 1 4 ! 1k # 1 22
Note that we get by substituting k # 1 for each n in the statement
We start with the left side and use the induction hypothesis to obtain the
right side of the equation:
