12.1 Sequences and Summation A sequence is a list of numbers written in a specific order.  For example, the
Notation height that a bouncing ball reaches after each bounce is a sequence. This 
sequence has a definite pattern; describing the pattern allows us to predict 
12.2 Arithmetic Sequences the height that the ball reaches after any number of bounces.

The amount in a bank account at the end of each month, mortgage payments,
and the amount of an annuity are also sequences. The formulas that generate
these sequences drive our economy-they allow us to borrow money to buy
our dream home closer to graduation than to retirement. In this chapter we
study these and other applications of sequences.
