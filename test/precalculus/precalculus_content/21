A polynomial function is a function that is defined by a polynomial expression. So a poly-
nomial function of degree n is a function of the form
P 1x 2 ! anxn # an"1xn"1 # p # a1x # a 0
Polynomial expressions are defined in We have already studied polynomial functions of degree 0 and 1. These are functions of
Section 1.3. the form P 1x 2 ! a 0 and P 1x 2 ! a1x # a0, respectively, whose graphs are lines. In this
section we study polynomial functions of degree 2. These are called quadratic functions. 
QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS
A quadratic function is a polynomial function of degree 2. So a quadratic func-
tion is a function of the form
f 1x 2 ! ax 2 # bx # c,  a $ 0
We see in this section how quadratic functions model many real-world phenomena. We
begin by analyzing the graphs of quadratic functions.
! Graphing Quadratic Functions Using the Standard Form
For a geometric definition of parabolas, If we take a ! 1 and b ! c ! 0 in the quadratic function ax 2 # bx # c
see Section 11.1.

f 1x 2 ! , we get
the quadratic function ! x 2 , whose graph is the parabola graphed in Example 1 of
Section 2.2. In fact, the graph of any quadratic function is a parabola; it can be obtained
from the graph of ! x 2 by the transformations given in Section 2.5.
