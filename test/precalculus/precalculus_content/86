12.2 ARITHMETIC SEQUENCES
Arithmetic Sequences ! Partial Sums of Arithmetic Sequences
In this section we study a special type of sequence, called an arithmetic sequence.
! Arithmetic Sequences
Perhaps the simplest way to generate a sequence is to start with a number a and add to it
a fixed constant d, over and over again.

DEFINITION OF AN ARITHMETIC SEQUENCE
An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of the form
a, a # d, a # 2d, a # 3d, a # 4d, . . .
The number a is the first term, and d is the common difference of the sequence.
The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by
an ! a # 1n " 1 2d
The number d is called the common difference because any two consecutive terms of
an arithmetic sequence differ by d.
