5.5 INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS AND THEIR GRAPHS
The Inverse Sine Function ! The Inverse Cosine Function ! The Inverse 
Tangent Function ! The Inverse Secant, Cosecant, and Cotangent Functions
We study applications of inverse Recall from Section 2.7 that the inverse of a function f is a function f#1 that reverses the rule
trigonometric functions to triangles of f. For a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one. Since the trigonometric func-
in Sections 6.4-6.6. tions are not one-to-one, they do not have inverses. It is possible, however, to restrict the do-
mains of the trigonometric functions in such a way that the resulting functions are one-to-one.
! The Inverse Sine Function
Let's3 first consider the sine function. There are many ways to restrict the domain of sine so thatthe new function is one-to-one. A natural way to do this is to restrict the domain to the inter-val #p/2, p/2 4 . The reason for this choice is that sine is one-to-one on this interval and
moreover attains each of the values in its range on this interval. From Figure 1 we see that sine
is one-to-one on this restricted domain (by the Horizontal Line Test) and so has an inverse.
