3.5 COMPLEX NUMBERS
Arithmetic Operations on Complex Numbers ! Square Roots of Negative
Numbers ! Complex Solutions of Quadratic Equations
In Section 1.5 we saw that if the discriminant of a quadratic equation is negative, the equa-
tion has no real solution. For example, the equation
x 2 # 4 ! 0
has no real solution. If we try to solve this eq
x ! $1uation, we get x2 ! "4, so"4
B1 ut this is impossible, since the square of any real number is positive. [For example,"2 2 2 ! 4, a positive number.] Thus, negative numbers don't have real square roots.
See the note on Cardano (page 274) for To make it possible to solve all quadratic equations, mathematicians invented an ex-
an example of how complex numbers panded number system, called the complex number system. First they defined the new

This means that i 2 ! "1. A complex number is then a number of the form a # bi, where
a and b are real numbers.
DEFINITION OF COMPLEX NUMBERS
A complex number is an expression of the form
a # bi
where a and b are real numbers and i2 ! "1. The real part of this complex
number is a and the imaginary part is b. Two complex numbers are equal if and
only if their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal.
Note that both the real and imaginary parts of a complex number are real numbers.

of the solutions of equations. In fact, imaginary numbers are useful not only in algebra and
mathematics, but in the other sciences as well. To give just one example, in electrical theory
the reactance of a circuit is a quantity whose measure is an imaginary number.
" Arithmetic Operations on Complex Numbers
Complex numbers are added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided just as we would any
number of the form a # b 1c. The only difference that we need to keep in mind is that

We therefore define the sum, difference, and product of complex numbers as follows.
