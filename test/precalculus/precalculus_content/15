2.3 GETTING INFORMATION FROM THE GRAPH OF A FUNCTION
Values of a Function; Domain and Range ! Increasing and Decreasing 
Functions ! Local Maximum and Minimum Values of a Function
Many properties of a function are more easily obtained from a graph than from the rule
that describes the function. We will see in this section how a graph tells us whether the
values of a function are increasing or decreasing and also where the maximum and mini-
mum values of a function are.
! Values of a Function; Domain and Range
A complete graph of a function contains all the information about a function, because the
graph tells us which input values correspond to which output values. To analyze the graph
of a function, we must keep in mind that the height of the graph is the value of the func-
tion. So we can read off the values of a function from its graph.

T (*F) The function T graphed in Figure 1 gives the temperature between noon and 6:00 P.M. at
40 a certain weather station.
30 (a) Find T 112, T 132, and T 152.
20 (b) Which is larger, T 12 2 or T 14 2?
10 (c) Find the value(s) of x for which T 1x 2 ! 25.
(d) Find the value(s) of x for which T 1x 2 # 25.

F I G U R E  1 Temperature function (a) T(1) is the temperature at 1:00 P.M. It is represented by the height of the graph
above the x-axis at x ! 1. Thus, T11 2 ! 25. Similarly, T 132 ! 30 and T 152 ! 20.
(b) Since the graph is higher at x! 2 than at x! 4, it follows that T 12 2 is larger than T 14 2.
(c) The height of the graph is 25 when x is 1 and when x is 4. In other words, the tem-
perature is 25 at 1:00 P.M. and 4:00 P.M.
(d) The graph is higher than 25 for x between 1 and 4. In other words, the temperature
was 25 or greater between 1:00 P.M. and 4:00 P.M.
