5TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS: UNIT CIRCLE APPROACH
5.1 The Unit Circle If you've ever taken a ferris wheel ride, then you know about periodic motion-
that is, motion that repeats over and over. Periodic motion is common in nature.
5.2 Trigonometric Functions Think about the daily rising and setting of the sun (day, night, day, night, . . .),
of Real Numbers the daily variation in tide levels (high, low, high, low, . . .), or the vibrations of a
5.3 Trigonometric Graphs leaf in the wind (left, right, left, right, . . .). To model such motion, we need a
5.4 More Trigonometric Graphs function whose values increase, then decrease, then increase, and so on. To un-
derstand how to define such a function, let's look at a person riding on a ferris
5.5 Inverse Trigonometric Functions wheel. The graph shows the height of the person above the center of the wheel at
and Their Graphs time t. Notice that the graph goes up and down repeatedly. 
5.6 Modeling Harmonic Motion The trigonometric function sine is defined in a similar way, using the unit cir-
cle (in place of the ferris wheel). The trigonometric functions can be defined in
FOCUS ON MODELING two different but equivalent ways: as functions of real numbers (Chapter 5) or as
Fitting Sinusoidal Curves functions of angles (Chapter 6). The two approaches are independent of each
to Data other, so either Chapter 5 or Chapter 6 may be studied first. We study both ap-
proaches because the different approaches are required for different applications.
