7.4 BASIC TRIGONOMETRIC EQUATIONS
Basic Trigonometric Equations ! Solving Trigonometric Equations 
by Factoring 
An equation that contains trigonometric functions is called a trigonometric equation.
For example, the following are trigonometric equations:
sin2 u ! cos2 u " 1 2 sin u # 1 " 0 tan 2u # 1 " 0
The first equation is an identity-that is, it is true for every value of the variable u. The
other two equations are true only for certain values of u. To solve a trigonometric equa-
tion, we find all the values of the variable that make the equation true. 
! Basic Trigonometric Equations
Solving any trigonometric equation always reduces to solving a basic trigonometric
equation-an equation of the form T1u 2 " c, where T is a trigonometric function and c
is a constant. In the next three examples we solve such basic equations.

Find all solutions. Because the sine function repeats its values every 2p units, we get all
solutions of the equation by adding integer multiples of 2p to these solutions:
