9.5 THE CROSS PRODUCT
The Cross Product ! Properties of the Cross Product ! Area 
of a Parallelogram ! Volume of a Parallelepiped
In this section we define an operation on vectors that allows us to find a vector which is
perpendicular to two given vectors.
! The Cross Product
Given two vectors a $ 8a1, a2, a39 and b $ 8b1  
c $ 8 , b2, b39 we often need to find a vector c per-pendicular to both a and b. If we write c1, c2, c39 then a # c $ 0 and b # c $ 0, so 
 a1c1 ! a2c2 ! a3c3 $ 0
 b1c1 ! b2c2 ! b3c3 $ 0
You 
c $ 8can check that one of the solutiona2b3 % a3b2, a3b1 % a1b3, a1b2 % a2b19s of this system of equations is the vector. This vector is called the cross product of a
and b and is denoted by a * b.
THE CROSS PRODUCT
If a $ 8a1, a2, a39 and b $ 8b1, b2, b39 are three-dimensional vectors, then the cross
product of a and b is the vector 
a * b $ 8a2b3 % a3b2,  a3b1 % a1b3,  a1b2 % a2b19
The cross product a * b of two vectors a and b, unlike the dot product, is a vector (not
a scalar). For this reason it is also called the vector product. Note that a * b is defined
only when a and b are vectors in three dimensions.
Determinants and their properties are To help us remember the definition of the cross product, we use the notation of deter-
studied in Section 10.7. minants. A determinant of order t` wo is da b ` efined by $ ad % bc

Observe that each term on the right side of the above equation involves a number ai in the
first row of the determinant, and ai is multiplied by the second-order determinant obtained
from the left side by deleting the row and column in which ai appears. Notice also the mi-
nus sign in the second term. For example,
