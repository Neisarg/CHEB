7.1 TRIGONOMETRIC IDENTITIES
Simplifying Trigonometric Expressions ! Proving Trigonometric Identities
We begin by listing some of the basic trigonometric identities. We studied most of these
in Chapters 5 and 6; you are asked to prove the cofunction identities in Exercise 102.

! Simplifying Trigonometric Expressions
Identities enable us to write the same expression in different ways. It is often possible to
rewrite a complicated-looking expression as a much simpler one. To simplify algebraic
expressions, we used factoring, common denominators, and the Special Product Formu-
las. To simplify trigonometric expressions, we use these same techniques together with
the fundamental trigonometric identities.

Simplify the expression ! .
cos u 1 ! sin u
S O L U T I O N We combine the fractions by using a common denominator:

 ! " Common denominator
cos u 1 ! sin u cos u 11 ! sin u 2
sin u ! sin2 u ! cos2 u
 " Distribute sin u
