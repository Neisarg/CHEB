In this section we use ta
f 1blx 2es of values and graphs of functions to answer the question, Whathappens to the values of a function f as the variable x approaches the number a?
! Definition of Limit
We begin by investigating the behavior of the function f defined by
f 1x 2 $ x2 " x # 2
for values of x near 2. The following tables give values of f 1x 2 for values of x close to 2
but not equal to 2.

From the table and the graph of f (a parabola) shown in Figure 1 we see that when x is
close to 2 (1onx 2 either side of 2), f 1x 2 is close to 4. In fact, it appears that we can make thevalues of f as close as we like to 4 by taking x sufficiently close to 2. We express this
by saying "the limit of the function f 1x 2 $ x2 " x # 2 as x approaches 2 is equal to 4."
The notation for this is
 lim 1x2 " x # 2 2 $ 4
xS2 
In general, we use the following notation.
DEFINITION OF THE LIMIT OF A FUNCTION
We write
lim f 1x 2 $ L
xSa 
and say
"the limit of f
f 1 1x 2 , as x approaches a, equals L"if we can make the values of x 2 arbitrarily close to L (as close to L as we like)
by taking x to be sufficiently close to a, but not equal to a.
Roughly speaking, this says that the values of f 1x 2 get closer and closer to the number
L as x gets closer and closer to the number a (from either side of a) but x ! a.

is
! L  as
which is usually read " approaches L as x approaches a." This is the notation we used
in Section
f 1 3x 2.7 when discussing asymptotes of rational functions.Notice the phrase "but x ! a" in the definition of limit. This means that in finding thelimit of as x approaches a, we never consider x $ a. In fact, f 1x 2 need not even be
defined when x $ a. The only thing that matters is how f is defined near a.

! Estimating Limits Numerically and Graphically
In Section 13.2 we will develop techniques for finding exact values of limits. For now, we
use tables and graphs to estimate limits of functions.

to 1).

As a graphical verification we use a graphing device to produce Figure 3. We see that
when x is close to 1, y is close to 0.5. If we use the ZOOM and TRACE features to get a
closer look, as in Figure 4, we notice that as x gets closer and closer to 1, y becomes closer
and closer to 0.5. This reinforces our conclusion.
