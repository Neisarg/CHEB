10.4 THE ALGEBRA OF MATRICES
Equality of Matrices ! Addition, Subtraction, and Scalar Multiplication of
Matrices ! Multiplication of Matrices ! Properties of Matrix Multiplication
! Applications of Matrix  Multiplication ! Computer Graphics
Thus far, we have used matrices simply for notational convenience when solving linear
systems. Matrices have many other uses in mathematics and the sciences, and for most of
these applications a knowledge of matrix algebra is essential. Like numbers, matrices can
be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided. In this section we learn how to perform
these algebraic operations on matrices.
! Equality of Matrices
Two matrices are equal if they have the same entries in the same positions.
