are defined, that is, if x belongs to the domain of f and also to the domain of g. So if
.
the domain of f is A and the domain of g is B, then the domain of f % g is the intersec-
tion of these domains, that is, A % B. Similarly, we can define the difference f $ g, the
product fg, and the quotient f/g of the functions f and g. Their domains are A % B, but
in the case of the quotient we must remember not to divide by 0.

The graph of the function f % g can be obtained from the graphs of f and g by graph-
ical addition. This means that we add corresponding y-coordinates, as illustrated in the
next example.
