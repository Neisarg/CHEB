! Geometric Definition of an Ellipse
An ellipse is an oval curve that looks like an elongated circle. More precisely, we have the
following definition.
P
GEOMETRIC DEFINITION OF AN ELLIPSE
F⁄ F¤ An ellipse is the set of all points in the plane the sum of whose distances from
two fixed points F1 and F2 is a constant. (See Figure 1.) These two fixed points
are the foci (plural of focus) of the ellipse.

The geometric definition suggests a simple method for drawing an ellipse. Place a
sheet of paper on a drawing board, and insert thumbtacks at the two points that are to be
the foci of the ellipse. Attach the ends of a string to the tacks, as shown in Figure 2(a).
With the point of a pencil, hold the string taut. Then carefully move the pencil around the
foci, keeping the string taut at all times. The pencil will trace out an ellipse, because the
sum of the distances from the point of the pencil to the foci will always equal the length
of the string, which is constant.
If the string is only slightly longer than the distance between the foci, then the ellipse that
is traced out will be elongated in shape, as in Figure 2(a), but if the foci are close together
relative to the length of the string, the ellipse will be almost circular, as shown in Figure 2(b).
