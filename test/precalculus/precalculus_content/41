5.6 MODELING HARMONIC MOTION
Simple Harmonic Motion ! Damped Harmonic Motion
Periodic behavior-behavior that repeats over and over again-is common in nature.
Perhaps the most familiar example is the daily rising and setting of the sun, which re-
sults in the repetitive pattern of day, night, day, night, . . . . Another example is the
daily variation of tide levels at the beach, which results in the repetitive pattern of high
tide, low tide, high tide, low tide, . . . . Certain animal populations increase and de-
crease in a predictable periodic pattern: A large population exhausts the food supply,
which causes the population to dwindle; this in turn results in a more plentiful food
supply, which makes it possible for the population to increase; and the pattern then re-
peats over and over (see the Discovery Project Predator/Prey Models referenced on
page 398).
Other common examples of periodic behavior involve motion that is caused by vibra-
tion or oscillation. A mass suspended from a spring that has been compressed and then al-
lowed to vibrate vertically is a simple example. This "back and forth" motion also occurs
in such diverse phenomena as sound waves, light waves, alternating electrical current, and
pulsating stars, to name a few. In this section we consider the problem of modeling peri-
odic behavior.
! Simple Harmonic Motion
The trigonometric functions are ideally suited for modeling periodic behavior. A glance
at the graphs of the sine and cosine functions, for instance, tells us that these functions
themselves exhibit periodic behavior. Figure 1 shows the graph of y! sin t. If we think of

again. Figure 2 shows that the motion of a vibrating mass on a spring is modeled very ac-
curately by y " sin t.

Notice that the mass returns to its original position over and over again. A cycle is one
complete vibration of an object, so the mass in Figure 2 completes one cycle of its mo-
tion between O and P. Our observations about how the sine and cosine functions model
periodic behavior are summarized in the following box.
