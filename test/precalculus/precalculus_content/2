1.2 EXPONENTS AND RADICALS
Integer Exponents " Rules for Working with Exponents " Scientific Notation
" Radicals " Rational Exponents " Rationalizing the Denominator
In this section we give meaning to expressions such as am/n in which the exponent m/n is
a rational number. To do this, we need to recall some facts about integer exponents, radi-
cals, and nth roots.

duct of identical numbers is usually written in exponential notation. For example,
5 is written as 53. In general, we have the following definition.
EXPONENTIAL NOTATION
If a is any real number and n is a positive integer, then the nth power of a is
an ! a # a # . . . # a

n factors
The number a is called the base, and n is called the exponent.
