3POLYNOMIAL AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS
3.1 Quadratic Functions Functions defined by polynomial expressions are called polynomial functions.
and Models The graphs of polynomial functions can have many peaks and valleys; this
makes them suitable models for many real-world situations. For example, a

Graphs increases, but if there are too many workers, productivity begins to decrease.
3.3 Dividing Polynomials This situation is modeled by a polynomial function of degree 2 (a quadratic
function). As another example, when a volleyball is hit, it goes up and then

many things. For example, sailboat designers put together portions of the
