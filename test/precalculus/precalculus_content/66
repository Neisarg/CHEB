9.6 EQUATIONS OF LINES AND PLANES
Equations of Lines ! Equations of Planes
In this section we find equations for lines and planes in a three-dimensional coordinate
space. We use vectors to help us find such equations. 
! Equations of Lines
T1 he position vector of a point A line L in three-dimensional space is determined when we know a point a1, a2, a3 2 8a1, a2, a39 P01x 0, y0, z0 2 onis the vector ; that L and the direction of L. In three dimensions the direction of a line is described by! a vec-
is, it is the vector from the origin to the tor v parallel to L. If we let r0 be the position vector of P0 (that is, the vector OP0), then
point. for all real numbers t, the terminal points P of the position vectors r0 ! t v trace out a line

P point P on L. So the line L is given by the position vector r, where

Let's write the vector v in component form v $ 8a, b, c9 and let 
x 0 r $ 8x, y, z9 r0 $ 8x 0, y0, z09 and. Then the vect
y  8or equx, y, z9ation$ 8  of the line becomes x 0, y0, z09 ! t 8a, b, c9
 $ 8x 0 ! ta, y0 ! tb, z0 ! tc9
F I G U R E  1 Since two vectors are equal if and only if their corresponding components are equal, we
have the following result.
