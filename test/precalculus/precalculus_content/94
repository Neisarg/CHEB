13.3 TANGENT LINES AND DERIVATIVES
The Tangent Lines ! Derivatives ! Instantaneous Rates of Change
In this section we see how limits arise when we attempt to find the tangent line to a curve
or the instantaneous rate of change of a function.
! The Tangent Problem
A tangent line is a line that just touches a curve. For instance, Figure 1 shows the parabola
y $ x2 and the tangent line t that touches the parabola at the point P11, 1 2 . We will be able
to find an equation of the tangent line t as soon as we know its slope m. The difficulty is that
we know only one point, P, on t, whereas we need two points to compute the slope. But ob-
serve that we can compute an approximation to m by choosing a nearby point Q1x, x2 2 on
the parabola (as in Figure 2) and computing the slope mPQ of the secant line PQ.

Now we let x approach 1, so Q approaches P along the parabola. Figure 3 shows how the
corresponding secant lines rotate about P and approach the tangent line t.

The point-slope form for the equation
of a line through the point 1x 1, y1 2 Now that we know the slope of the tangent line is m $ 2, we can use the point-slope formwith of the equation of a line to find its equation.
slope m is
y " 1 $ 21x " 1 2  or  y $ 2x " 1
y " y1 $ m1x " x 1 2
We sometimes refer to the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a point as the slope of
(See Section 1.10.) the curve at the point. The idea is that if we zoom in far enough toward the point, the
curve looks almost like a straight line. Figure 4 illustrates this procedure for the curve 
y $ x2. The more we zoom in, the more the parabola looks like a line. In other words, the
curve becomes almost indistinguishable from its tangent line.

If we have a general cur
P1 f xa, f 1vea 2 2C with equation y $ 1 2 and we want to find the tangentline to C at the point , then we consider a nearby point Q1x, f 1x 22 , where x ! a,
and compute the slope of the secant line PQ

mPQ $ x " a
Then we let Q approach P along the curve C by letting x approach a. If mPQ approaches a
number m, then we define the tangent t to be the line through P with slope m. (This
amounts to saying that the tangent line is the limiting position of the secant line PQ as Q
approaches P. See Figure 5.)
