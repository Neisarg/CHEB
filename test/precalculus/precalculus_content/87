In this section we study geometric sequences. This type of sequence occurs frequently in
applications to finance, population growth, and other fields.
! Geometric Sequences
Recall that an arithmetic sequence is generated when we repeatedly add a number d to an
initial term a. A geometric sequence is generated when we start with a number a and re-
peatedly multiply by a fixed nonzero constant r.
DEFINITION OF A GEOMETRIC SEQUENCE
A geometric sequence is a sequence of the form
a 2, ar, ar 3 , ar , ar 4 , . . .
The number a is the first term, and r is the common ratio of the sequence. The
nth term of a geometric sequence is given by
an ! ar
n"1
The number r is called the common ratio because the ratio of any two consecutive
terms of the sequence is r.

(a) If a ! 3 and r ! 2, then we have the geometric sequence
3,  3 # 2,  3 # 22,  3 # 23,  3 # 24,  . . .
or 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, . . .
Notice that the ratio of any two consecutive terms is r ! 2. The nth term is
an ! 312 2 n"1.
(b) The sequence
2, "10, 50, "250, 1250, . . .
is a geometric sequence with a ! 2 and r ! "5. When r is negative, the terms of
the sequence alternate in sign. The nth term is an ! 21"5 2 n"1.
(c) The sequence

is a geometric sequence with a ! 1 and an ! 1A13Bn"1r ! 13. The nth term is .

20 (d) The graph of the geometric sequence a 1n ! 5 # 2n"1 is shown in Figure 1. Notice that
the points in the graph lie on the graph of the exponential function y ! 1 x"15 # 2 .
If 0 % r % 1, then the terms of the geometric sequence arn"1 decrease, but if r & 1, then
the terms increase. (What happens if r ! 1?)
