Determinants
If a matrix is square (that is, if it has the same number of rows as columns), then we can
assign to it a number called its determinant. Determinants can be used to solve systems
of linear equations, as we will see later in this section. They are also useful in determin-
ing whether a matrix has an inverse.
! Determinant of a 2 ! 2 Matrix
We denote the determinant of a square matrix A by the symbol det1A2 or !A !. We first de-
fine det1A2 for the simplest cases. If A ! "a' is a 1 " 1 matrix, then det1A2 ! a. The fol-
lowing box gives the definition of a 2 " 2 determinant.

S E C T I O N  1 0 . 6 | Determinants and Cramer's Rule 685
The following criterion allows us to determine whether a square matrix has an inverse
without actually calculating the inverse. This is one of the most important uses of the
determinant in matrix algebra, and it is the reason for the name determinant.
INVERTIBILIT Y CRITERION
If A is a square matrix, then A has an inverse if and only if det1A2 % 0.
We will not prove this fact, but from the formula for the inverse of a 2 " 2 matrix 
(page 674) you can see why it is true in the 2 " 2 case.

S O L U T I O N We begin by calculating the determinant of A. Since all but one of the 
elements of the second row is zero, we expand the determinant by the second row. If we
do this, we see from the following equation that only the cofactor A24 will have to be 
calculated.

Since the determinant of A is zero, A cannot have an inverse, by the Invertibility Criterion.
