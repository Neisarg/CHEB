Let's review the types of numbers that make up the real number system. We start with the
natural numbers:
1, 2, 3, 4, . . .
The different types of real numbers The integers consist of the natural numbers together with their negatives and 0:
were invented to meet specific needs.
For exampl . . . , #3, #2, #1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .e, natural numbers are
needed for counting, negative num- We construct the rational numbers by taking ratios of integers. Thus, any rational num-
bers for describing debt or below-zero ber r can be expressed as
temperatures, rational numbers for 
m
concepts like "half a gallon of milk," r !
and irrational numbers for measuring n
certain distances, like the diagonal where m and n are integers and n " 0. Examples are
of a square.

2   #7  1 46 ! 0.17 !

(Recall that division by 0 is always ruled out, so expressions like 3 00 and 0 are undefined.)
There are also real numbers, such as 2, that cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers
and are therefore called irrational numbers. It can be shown, with varying degrees of
difficulty, that these nu1mbers are also irrational:3   15   13 32   p

The set of all real numbers is usually denoted by the symbol !. When we use the word
number without qualification, we will mean "real number." Figure 1 is a diagram of the
types of real numbers that we work with in this book.

Every real number has a decimal representation. If the number is rational, then its cor-
is a rational number. To convert it to a responding decimal is repeating. For example,
ratio of two integers, we write
1 .5000. . . ! 0.50 22 ! 0 3 ! 0.66666. . . ! 0.6

x by appropriate powers of 10 and then
subtract to eliminate the repeating part.) 12 ! 1.414213562373095. . .   p ! 3.141592653589793. . .

If we stop the decimal expansion of any number at a certain place, we get an approxima-
tion to the number. For instance, we can write
p ! 3.14159265
where the symbol ! is read "is approximately equal to." The more decimal places we re-
tain, the better our approximation.

We all know that 2 $ 3 ! 3 $ 2, and 5 $ 7 ! 7 $ 5, and 513 $ 87 ! 87 $ 513, and so
on. In algebra, we express all these (infinitely many) facts by writing
a $ b ! b $ a
where a and b stand for any two numbers. In other words, "a $ b ! b $ a" is a concise
way of saying that "when we add two numbers, the order of addition doesn't matter." This
fact is called the Commutative Property for addition. From our experience with numbers
we know that the properties in the following box are also valid.

The Distributive Property applies whenever we multiply a number by a sum. 
Figure 2 explains why this property works for the case in which all the numbers are pos-
itive integers, but the property is true for any real numbers a, b, and c.
The Distributive Property is crucial 2(3+5)
because it describes the way addition
and multiplication interact with each
other.
