The Factor Theorem tells us that finding the zeros of a polynomial is really the same thing
as factoring it into linear factors. In this section we study some algebraic methods that
help us to find the real zeros of a polynomial and thereby factor the polynomial. We be-
gin with the rational zeros of a polynomial.

From the factored form we see that the zeros of P are 2, 3, and "4. When the polynomial
is expanded, the constant 24 is obtained by multiplying 1"2 2 ' 1"3 2 ' 4. This means
that the zeros of the polynomial are all factors of the constant term. The following gener-
alizes this observation.
RATIONAL ZEROS THEOREM
If the polynomial P1x 2 ! an x n # a   n"1xn"1 . .  # . # a1x # a0 has integer
coefficients, then every rational zero of P is of the form
p
q
where p is a factor of the constant coefficient a0
and q is a factor of the leading coefficient an.
P R O O F If p/q is a rational zero, in lowest terms, of the polynomial P, then we have
 an a pq b n # an"1 a pq b n"1 # . . . # a1 a pq b # a0 ! 0
 . .
 an pn # a pn"1 . Multiply by qn  n"1 q # # a  1pqn"1 # a0qn ! 0
. .
 p1an pn"1 # a n 2 . # a  n"1 p " q #  1qn"1 2 ! "a0qn Subtract a0qn
and factor LHS
Now p is a factor of the left side, so it must be a factor of the right side as well. Since p/q
is in lowest terms, p and q have no factor in common, so p must be a factor of a0. A sim-
ilar proof shows that q is a factor of an. "
We see from the Rational Zeros Theorem that if the leading coefficient is 1 or "1, then
the rational zeros must be factors of the constant term.
