Equations
In the preceding section we saw that when the dimensions are appropriate, matrices can
be added, subtracted, and multiplied. In this section we investigate division of matrices.
With this operation we can solve equations that involve matrices.
! The Inverse of a Matrix
First, we define identity matrices, which play the same role for matrix multiplication as the
number 1 does for ordinary multiplication of numbers; that is, 1 ( a! a ( 1 ! a for all num-
bers a. A square matrix is one that has the same number of rows as columns. The main di-
agonal of a square matrix consists of the entries whose row and column numbers are the
same. These entries stretch diagonally down the matrix, from top left to bottom right.
IDENTIT Y MATRIX
The identity matrix In is the n $ n matrix for which each main diagonal entry is 
a 1 and for which all other entries are 0.

the appropriate dimension leaves the matrix unchanged.
