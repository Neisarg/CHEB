1.5 EQUATIONS
Solving Linear Equations " Solving Quadratic Equations " Other Types 
of Equations
An equation is a statement that two mathematical expressions are equal. For example,
3 % 5 ! 8
is an equation. Most equations that we study in algebra contain variables, which are sym-
bols (usually letters) that stand for numbers. In the equation
x ! 3 is a solution of the equation 
4x % 7 ! 19, because substituting 4x % 7 ! 19
x ! 3 makes the equation true: the letter x is the variable. We think of x as the "unknown" in the equation, and our goal
x
41! is to find the value of x that makes the equation true. The values of the unknown that makethe equation true are called the solutions or roots of the equation, and the process of find-3 23% 7 ! 19 # ing the solutions is called solving the equation.
Two equations with exactly the same solutions are called equivalent equations. To
solve an equation, we try to find a simpler, equivalent equation in which the variable
stands alone on one side of the "equal" sign. Here are the properties that we use to solve
an equation. (In these properties, A, B, and C stand for any algebraic expressions, and the
symbol 3 means "is equivalent to.")
PROPERTIES OF EQUALIT Y
Property Description
1. A ! B 3 A % C ! B % C Adding the same quantity to both sides of
an equation gives an equivalent equation.
2. A! B 3 CA! CB (C# 0) Multiplying both sides of an equation by
the same nonzero quantity gives an equiv-
alent equation.

These properties require that you perform the same operation on both sides of an equa-
tion when solving it. Thus, if we say "add $7" when solving an equation, that is just a
short way of saying "add $7 to each side of the equation."
! Solving Linear Equations
The simplest type of equation is a linear equation, or first-degree equation, which is an
equation in which each term is either a constant or a nonzero multiple of the variable.
LINEAR EQUATIONS
A linear equation in one variable is an equation equivalent to one of the form
ax % b ! 0
where a and b are real numbers and x is the variable.
Here are some examples that illustrate the difference between linear and nonlinear equa-
tions.
