Parametric Curves
So far, we have described a curve by giving an equation (in rectangular or polar coordi-
nates) that the coordinates of all the points on the curve must satisfy. But not all curves in
the plane can be described in this way. In this section we study parametric equations,
which are a general method for describing any curve.
! Plane Curves and Parametric Equations
We can think of a curve as the path of a point moving in the plane; the x- and 
y-coordinates of the point are then functions of time. This idea leads to the following
definition.
PL ANE CURVES AND PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS
If f and g are functions defined on an interval I, then the set of points 1f 1t 2 , g1t 22
is a plane curve. The equations
x % f 1t 2   y % g1t 2
where t # I, are parametric equations for the curve, with parameter t.

As t increases, a particle whose position is given by the parametric equations moves
along the curve in the direction of the arrows.

If we replace t by "t in Example 1, we obtain the parametric equations
x % t2 ! 3t   y % "t " 1
The graph of these parametric equations (see Figure 2) is the same as the curve in Figure 1,
but traced out in the opposite direction. On the other hand, if we replace t by 2t in Example
1, we obtain the parametric equations
x % 4t2 " 6t   y % 2t " 1
The graph of these parametric equations (see Figure 3) is again the same, but is traced out
"twice as fast." Thus, a parametrization contains more information than just the shape of
the curve; it also indicates how the curve is being traced out.
