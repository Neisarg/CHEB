9.4 VECTORS IN THREE DIMENSIONS
Vectors in Space ! Combining Vectors in Space ! The Dot Product 
for Vectors in Space
Recall that vectors are used to indicate a quantity that has both magnitude and direction.
In Section 9.1 we studied vectors in the coordinate plane, where the direction is restricted
to two dimensions. Vectors in space have a direction that is in three-dimensional space.
The properties that hold for vectors in the plane hold for vectors in space as well. 
! Vectors in Space
z Recall from Section 9.1 that a vector can be described geometrically by its initial point
(a⁄, a¤, a‹) and terminal point. When we place a vector a in space with its initial point at the origin,
we can describe it algebraically as an ordered triple
a
0 a $ 8a1, a2, a39:
where a1, a2, and a3 are the components of a (see Figure 1). Recall also that a vector has
x y
many different representations, depending on its initial point. The following definition
gives the relationship between the algebraic and geometric representations of a vector.
