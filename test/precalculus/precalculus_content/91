LIMITS: A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS
13.1 Finding Limits Numerically In this chapter we study the central idea underlying calculus: the concept of a
and Graphically limit. Calculus is used in modeling numerous real-life phenomena, particularly
situations that involve change or motion. Limits are used in finding the instan-
13.2 Finding Limits Algebraically
taneous rate of change of a function as well as the area of a region with curved
13.3 Tangent Lines and Derivatives boundary. You will learn in calculus that these two apparently different prob-
13.4 Limits at Infinity; Limits lems are closely related. In this chapter we see how limits allow us to solve
of Sequences both problems.
In Chapter 2 we learned how to find the average rate of change of a func-
13.5 Areas tion. For example, to find the average speed, we divide the total distance trav-
FOCUS ON MODELING eled by the total time. But how can we find instantaneous speed-that is, the
Interpretations of Area speed at a given instant? We can't divide the total distance by the total time be-
cause in an instant the total distance traveled is zero and the total time spent
traveling is zero! But we can find the average rate of change on smaller and
smaller intervals, zooming in on the instant we want. In other words, the in-
stantaneous speed is a limit of the average speeds. 
To find the area of region with curved sides, we approximate the area by in-
scribing polygons in the region. The figure illustrates how this is done for a
circle. If we let An be the area of the inscribed polygon with n sides, then we
see that as n increases, An gets closer and closer to the area A of the circle. In
other words, the area A is the limit of the areas An.
