! Using Graphing Devices to Graph Trigonometric Functions
The graph of a function gives us a better idea of its behavior. So, in this section we graph
the sine and cosine functions and certain transformations of these functions. The other
trigonometric functions are graphed in the next section.
! Graphs of Sine and Cosine
To help us graph the sine and cosine functions, we first observe that these functions repeat
their values in a regular fashion. To see exactly how this happens, recall that the circumfer-
ence of the unit circle is 2p. It follows that the terminal point P1x, y 2 determined by the real
number t is the same as that determined by t ! 2p. Since the sine and cosine functions are

defined in terms of the coordinates of P1x, y 2 , it follows that their values are unchanged by
the addition of any integer multipl
 sin1t ! 2np 2e of 2p. In other words," sin t    for any integer n
 cos1t ! 2np 2 " cos t   for any integer n
Thus, the sine and cosine functions are periodic according to the following definition: A
function f is periodic if there is a positive number p such that f 1t ! p 2 " f 1t 2 for every t.
The least such positive number (if it exists) is the period of f. If f has period p, then the
graph of f on any interval of length p is called one complete period of f.
PERIODIC PROPERTIES OF SINE AND COSINE
The functions sine and cosine have period 2p:
sin1t ! 2p 2 " sin t          c os1t ! 2p 2 " cos t
T A B L E  1
So the sine and cosine functions repeat their values in any interval of length 2p. To sketch
t sin t cos t their graphs, we first graph one period. To sketch the graphs on the interval 0 - t - 2p, we
p could try to make a table of values and use those points to draw the graph. Since no such table
0! 0 ! 1 1 ! 0
2 can be complete, let's look more closely at the definitions of these functions.

It's easy to see that the y-coordinate of increases to 1, then decreases to #1 re-
peatedly as the point travels around the unit circle. (See Figure 1.) In fact, as t in-
3p creases from 0 to p/2, y " sin t increases from 0 to 1. As t increases from p/2 to p, the

sine functions for t between 0 and 2p.

Now we use this information to graph the functions sin t and cos t for t between
0 and 2p in Figures 2 and 3. These are the graphs of one period. Using the fact that these
functions are periodic with period 2p, we get their complete graphs by continuing the same
pattern to the left and to the right in every successive interval of length 2p.
The graph of the sine function is symmetric with respect to the origin. This is as ex-
pected, since sine is an odd function. Since the cosine function is an even function, its
graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.

! Graphs of Transformations of Sine and Cosine
We now consider graphs of functions that are transformations of the sine and cosine func-
tions. Thus, the graphing techniques of Section 2.5 are very useful here. The graphs we
obtain are important for understanding applications to physical situations such as har-
monic motion (see Section 5.6), but some of them are beautiful graphs that are interest-
ing in their own right.
It's traditional to use the letter x to denote the variable in the domain of a function. So
from here on we use the letter x and write y " sin x, y " cos x, y " tan x, and so on to
denote these functions.
