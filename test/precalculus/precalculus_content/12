2.1 What Is a Function? Perhaps the most useful idea for modeling the real world is the concept of
function. Let's look at an example. If a rock climber drops a stone from a high

cliff, we know that the stone will fall. But this general description doesn't help
2.3 Getting Information from the us figure out when the stone will hit the ground. To find out, we need a rule

2.4 Average Rate of Change was the first to discover the rule: In t seconds the stone falls feet. This
of a Function "rule" is called a function; we write this function as d1 1 tt 2 6 2! 16t 2. Using this
function model, we can predict when the stone will hit the ground. In this
2.5 Transformations of Functions chapter we study properties of functions and how function models can help us
2.6 Combining Functions to get precise information about the thing or process being modeled.
