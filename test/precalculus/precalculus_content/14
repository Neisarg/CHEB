2.2 GRAPHS OF FUNCTIONS
Graphing Functions by Plotting Points ! Graphing Functions with a 
Graphing Calculator ! Graphing Piecewise Defined Functions ! The Vertical
Line Test ! Equations That Define Functions
The most important way to visualize a function is through its graph. In this section we in-
vestigate in more detail the concept of graphing functions.

we plot the points whose x-coordinate is an input and whose y-coordinate is the cor-
responding output of the function.

THE GRAPH OF A FUNCTION
If f is a function with domain A,5 1then the graph of f is the set of ordered pairsx, f 1x 2 2 0  x ! A6
p1 lotted in a coordinate plane. In other words, the graph of f is the set of all pointsx, y 2
y ! f 1such that ; that is, the graph of f is the graph of the equationx 2 y ! f 1x 2.

Óx, ÏÔ The graph of a function f gives a picture of the behavior or "life history" of the func-tion. We can read the value of f 1x 2 from the graph as being the height of the graph above
the point x (see Figure 1).
A function f of the form f 1x 2 ! mx % b is called a linear function because its graph
f(2) Ï
is the graph of the equation y ! mx % b, which represents a line with slope m and 
y-intercept b. A special case of a linear function occurs when the slope is m! 0. The func-
f(1) tion f 1x 2 ! b, where b is a given number, is called a constant function because all its val-
0 1 2 x x ues are the same number, namely, b. Its graph is the horizontal line y ! b. Figure 2 shows
the graphs of the constant function f 1x 2 ! 3 and the linear function f 1x 2 ! 2x % 1.
