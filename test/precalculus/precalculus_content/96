13.5 AREAS
The Area Problem ! Definition of Area
We have seen that limits are needed to compute the slope of a tangent line or an instanta-
neous rate of change. Here we will see that they are also needed to find the area of a re-
gion with a curved boundary. The problem of finding such areas has consequences far be-
yond simply finding area. (See Focus on Modeling, page 884.)
! The Area Problem
One of the central problems in 
y $ f 1cax 2lculus is the area problem: Find the area of the region Sthat lies under the curve from a to b. This means that S, illustrated in Figure 1,
is bounded by the graph of a function f (where f 1x 2 ' 0), the vertical lines x $ a and 
x $ b, and the x-axis.

In trying to solve the area problem, we have to ask ourselves: What is the meaning of
the word area? This question is easy to answer for regions with straight sides. For a rec-
tangle, the area is defined as the product of the length and the width. The area of a trian-
gle is half the base times the height. The area of a polygon is found by dividing it into tri-
angles (as in Figure 2) and adding the areas of the triangles.

However, it is not so easy to find the area of a region with curved sides. We all have an
intuitive idea of what the area of a region is. But part of the area problem is to make this
intuitive idea precise by giving an exact definition of area.
Recall that in defining a tangent, we first approximated the slope of the tangent line by
slopes of secant lines, and then we took the limit of these approximations. We pursue a
similar idea for areas. We first approximate the region S by rectangles, and then we take
the limit of the areas of these rectangles as we increase the number of rectangles. The fol-
lowing example illustrates the procedure.

Suppose we divide S into four strips S1, S2, S3, and S4 by drawing the vertical lines
x $ 1 14, x $ 2, and x $ 34 as in Figure 4(a). We can approximate each strip by a rectangle
whose base is the same as the strip and whose height is the same as the right edge of the
strip (see Figure 4(b)). In other words, the heights of these rectangles are the values of the
function f 1x 2 $ x2 at the right endpoints of the subintervals 30, 1 1 1  4 4 , 3 4,  2 4 , 3 1 3 32,  4 4 , and 3 4,  1 4 .

We see that the area of S is larger than L4, so we have lower and upper estimates for A:
0.21875 % A % 0.46875
We can repeat this procedure with a larger number of strips. Figure 6 shows what hap-
pens when we divide the region S into eight strips of equal width. By computing the sum
of the1  arR8 2eas of the smaller rectangles 1L8 2 and the sum of the areas of the larger rectan-gles , we obtain better lower and upper estimates for A:
0.2734375 % A % 0.3984375
So one possible answer to the question is to say that the true area of S lies somewhere be-
tween 0.2734375 and 0.3984375.
