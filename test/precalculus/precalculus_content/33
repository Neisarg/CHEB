4.5 EXPONENTIAL AND LOGARITHMIC EQUATIONS
Exponential Equations ! Logarithmic Equations ! Compound Interest
In this section we solve equations that involve exponential or logarithmic functions. The
techniques that we develop here will be used in the next section for solving applied
problems.
! Exponential Equations
An exponential equation is one in which the variable occurs in the exponent. For example,
2x ! 7
The variable x presents a difficulty because it is in the exponent. To deal with this
difficulty, we take the logarithm of each side and then use the Laws of Logarithms to
"bring down x" from the exponent.
 2x ! 7 Given equation
 ln x 2 ! ln 7 Take ln of each side
 x ln 2 ! ln 7 Law 3 (bring down exponent)
ln 7
 x ! Solve for x

Recall that Law 3 of the Laws of Logarithms says that loga AC ! C loga A.
The method that we used to solve 2x ! 7 is typical of how we solve exponential equa-
tions in general.
GUIDELINES FOR SOLVING EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS
1. Isolate the exponential expression on one side of the equation.
2. Take the logarithm of each side, then use the Laws of Logarithms to "bring
down the exponent."
3. Solve for the variable.
