CONIC SECTIONS
11.1 Parabolas Conic sections are the curves we get when we make a straight cut in a cone, as
shown in the figure. For example, if a cone is cut horizontally, the cross section
11.2 Ellipses is a circle. So a circle is a conic section. Other ways of cutting a cone produce
11.3 Hyperbolas parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas.
11.4 Shifted Conics
11.5 Rotation of Axes
11.6 Polar Equations of Conics
FOCUS ON MODELING
Conics in Architecture
Circle Ellipse Parabola Hyperbola
Our goal in this chapter is to find equations whose graphs are the conic 
sections. We already know from Section 1.8 that the graph of the equation
x 2 ! y 2 " r 2 is a circle. We will find equations for each of the other conic
sections by analyzing their geometric properties.
The conic sections have interesting properties that make them useful for
many real-world applications. For instance, a reflecting surface with parabolic
cross-sections concentrates light at a single point. This property of a parabola
is used in the construction of solar power plants, like the one in California pic-
tured above.
