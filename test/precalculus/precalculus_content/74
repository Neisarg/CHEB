10.7 PARTIAL FRACTIONS
Distinct Linear Factors ! Repeated Linear Factors ! Irreducible Quadratic
Factors ! Repeated Irreducible Quadratic Factors
To write a sum or difference of fractional expressions as a single fraction, we bring them
Common denominator to a common denominator. For example,
1 1 3x 1 1 121x $ 1 22 1$ 1x # 1 2$ !x # 1 2x $ 1 2x2 # x # 1 x # 1 2x $ 1 2 3x$ ! !x # 1 2x $ 1 2x2 # x # 1
Partial fractions But for some applications of algebra to calculus we must reverse this process-that is, we
must express a fraction s x/ 12x2 # x # 1 2
1/ 1 3x # 1 2  and 1/ 12x $ 1 2uch as as the sum of the simpler fractions . These simpler fractions are called partial fractions; we learn
how to find them in this section.
Let r be the rational function
r1x 2 P1x 2! Q1x 2
where the degree of P is less than the degree of Q. By the Linear and Quadratic Factors
Theorem in Section 3.6, every polynomial with real coefficients can be factored com-
pletely into linear and irreducible quadratic factors, that is, factors of the form ax $ b and
ax2 $ bx $ c, where a, b, and c are real numbers. For instance,
x4 # 1 ! 1x2 # 1 2 1x2 $ 1 2 ! 1x # 1 2 1x $ 1 2 1x2 $ 1 2
After we have completely factored the denominator Q of r, we can express r1x 2 as a sum
of partial fractions of the form
1 A Ax $ B  and  ax $ b 2 i 1ax2 $ bx $ c 2 j
This sum is called the partial fraction decomposition of r. Let's examine the details of
the four possible cases.
! Distinct Linear Factors
We first consider the case in which the denominator factors into distinct linear factors.
CASE 1: THE DENOMINATOR IS A PRODUCT  OF DISTINCT LINEAR FACTORS
Suppose that we can
Q1 fax 2 ctor! 1 Q1x2 asa1x $ b1 2 1a2x $ b2 2 # # # 1anx $ bn 2
with no
P1x 2 /Q1 fax 2ctor repeated. In this case the partial fraction decomposition oftakes the form
