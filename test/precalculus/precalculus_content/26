3.6 COMPLEX ZEROS AND THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ALGEBRA
The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and Complete Factorization ! Zeros
and Their Multiplicities ! Complex Zeros Come in Conjugate Pairs ! Linear
and Quadratic Factors
We have already seen that an nth-degree polynomial can have at most n real zeros. In the
complex number system an nth-degree polynomial has exactly n zeros and so can be fac-
tored into exactly n linear factors. This fact is a consequence of the Fundamental Theorem
of Algebra, which was proved by the German mathematician C. F. Gauss in 1799 (see
page 272).
" The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra 
and Complete Factorization
The following theorem is the basis for much of our work in factoring polynomials and
solving polynomial equations.
FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ALGEBRA
Every polynomial
P1x 2 ! an xn # a xn"1 # . . .  n"1 # a1x # a0  1n ) 1, an ' 0 2
with complex coefficients has at least one complex zero.
Because any real number is also a complex number, the theorem applies to polynomi-
als with real coefficients as well.

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and the Factor Theorem together show that a
polynomial can be factored completely into linear factors, as we now prove.
COMPLETE FACTORIZ ATION THEOREM
If P1x 2 is a polynomial of degree n ) 1, then there exist complex numbers 
a, c1, c2, . . . , cn (with a ' 0) such that
P1x 2 ! a1x " c1 2 1x " c2 2 p 1x " cn 2
P R O O F By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, P has at least one zero. Let's call it
c1. By the Factor Theorem (see pa P1x 2
" c1 2 # Q11x 2

where is of degree n" 1. Applying the Fundamental Theorem to the quotient Q11x 2
gives us the factorization

x 221x 2where is of degree n " 2 and c2 is a zero of . Continuing this process for n
steps, we get a final quotient of degree 0, a nonzero constant that we will call a.
This means that P has been factored as
P1x 2 ! a1x " c1 2 1x " c2 2 p 1x " cn 2 !
To actually find the complex zeros of an nth-degree polynomial, we usually first factor
as much as possible, then use the quadratic formula on parts that we can't factor further.

Let P1x 2 ! x3 " 3x2 # x " 3.
(a) Find all the zeros of P.
(b) Find the complete factorization of P.
S O L U T I O N
(a) We first factor P as follows.
! x3 P1x 2 " 3x2 # x " 3
 ! x21x " 3 2 # 1 Givenx " 3 2
 ! 1x " 3 2 1x2 # 1 2 Group termsFactor x " 3
We find the zeros of P by setting each factor equal to 0:
P1x 2 ! 1x " 3 2 1x2 # 1 2
This factor is 0 when x ! 3 This factor is 0 when x ! i or "i
Setting x " 3 ! 0, we see that x ! 3 is a zero. Setting x2 # 1 ! 0, we get 
x2 ! "1, so x ! $i. So the zeros of P are 3, i, and "i.
(b) Since the zeros are 3, i, and "i, by the Complete Factorization Theorem P factors
as
 P1x 2 ! 1x " 3 2 1x " i 2 3x " 1
 ! 1x " 3 2 1x " i 2 1x # i 2"i 2 4
