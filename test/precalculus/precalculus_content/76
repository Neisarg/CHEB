Inequalities ! Application: Feasible Regions
y In this section we study systems of inequalities in two variables from a graphical point 
of view. 
y=≈ ! Graphing an Inequality

symbol (, we obtain the inequality

Its graph consists of not just the parabola in Figure 1, but also every point whose 
y-coordinate is larger than x2. We indicate the solution in Figure 2(a) by shading the
points above the parabola.
Similarly, the graph of y ) x 2 in Figure 2(b) consists of all points on and below the
parabola. However, the graphs of y * x 2 and y + x 2 do not include the points on the
parabola itself, as indicated by the dashed curves in Figures 2(c) and 2(d).

The graph of an inequality, in general, consists of a region in the plane whose bound-
ary is the graph of the equation obtained by replacing the inequality sign 1(, ), *, or +2
with an equal sign. To determine which side of the graph gives the solution set of the in-
equality, we need only check test points.
GRAPHING INEQUALITIES
To graph an inequality, we carry out the following steps.
1. Graph Equation. Graph the equation corresponding to the inequality. Use a
dashed curve for * or + and a solid curve for ) or (.
2. Test Points. Test one point in each region formed by the graph in Step 1. If the
point satisfies the inequality, then all the points in that region satisfy the inequal-
ity. (In that case, shade the region to indicate that it is part of the graph.) If the
test point does not satisfy the inequality, then the region isn't part of the graph.

(a) The graph of x2 $ y2 ! 25 is a circle of radius 5 centered at the origin. The points 
on the circle itself do not satisfy the inequality because it is of the form +, so we 
y graph the circle with a dashed curve, as shown in Figure 3.
To determine whether the inside or the outside of the circle satisfies the inequal-
≈+¥<25 ity, we use the test points 10, 02 on the inside and 16, 02 on the outside. To do this, we
substitute the coordinates of each point into the inequality and check whether the
result satisfies the inequality. (Note that any point inside or outside the circle can
1 (6, 0) serve as a test point. We have chosen these points for simplicity.)

Our check shows that the points above the line satisfy the inequality.
Alternatively, we could put the inequality into slope-intercept form and graph it

From this form we see that the graph includes all points whose y-coordinates are
greater than those on the line y ! #1 52 x $ 2; that is, the graph consists of the points
on or above this line, as shown in Figure 4.
