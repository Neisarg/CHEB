1.1 Real Numbers In this first chapter we review the real numbers, equations, and the coordinate
plane. You are probably already familiar with these concepts, but it is help-
1.2 Exponents and Radicals ful to get a fresh look at how these ideas work together to solve problems 
1.3 Algebraic Expressions and model (or describe) real-world situations.
Let's see how all these ideas are used in a real-life situation: Suppose 
1.4 Rational Expressions you get paid $9 an hour at your part-time job. We can model your pay y
1.5 Equations for working x hours by the equation y ! 9x.  To find out how many hours 
you need to work to get paid 200 dollars, we solve the equation 200 ! 9x.
1.6 Modeling with Equations Graphing the equation y ! 9x in a coordinate plane helps us "see" how 
1.7 Inequalities pay increases with hours worked.
