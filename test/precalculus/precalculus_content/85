12.1 SEQUENCES AND SUMMATION NOTATION
Sequences ! Recursively Defined Sequences ! The Partial Sums 
of a Sequence ! Sigma Notation
Roughly speaking, a sequence is an infinite list of numbers. The numbers in the sequence
are often written as a1, a2, a3, . . . . The dots mean that the list continues forever. A simple
example is the sequence
5,  10,  15,  20,  25, . . .
! ! ! ! !
a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 . . .
We can describe the pattern of the sequence displayed above by the following formula:
an ! 5n
You may have already thought of a different way to describe the pattern-namely, "you
go from one number to the next by adding 5." This natural way of describing the sequence
is expressed by the recursive formula:
an ! an"1 # 5
starting with a1 ! 5. Try substituting n ! 1, 2, 3, . . . in each of these formulas to see how
they produce the numbers in the sequence. In this section we see how these different ways
are used to describe specific sequences.
! Sequences
Any ordered list of numbers can be viewed as a function whose input values are 1, 2,
3, . . . and whose output values are the numbers in the list. So we define a sequence as 
follows:
DEFINITION OF A SEQUENCE
A sequence is a function f whose domain is the set of natural numbers. The
terms of the sequence are the function values 
f 11 2 , f 12 2 , f 13 2 , . . . , f 1n 2 , . . .
We usually write an instead of the function notation f 1n 2 . So the terms of the se-
quence are written as
a1, a2, a3, . . . , an, . . . 
The number a1 is called the first term, a2 is called the second term, and in gen-
eral, an is called the nth term.
Here is a simple example of a sequence:
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, . . .
We can write a sequence in this way when it's clear what the subsequent terms of the se-
Another way to write this sequence is quence are. This sequence consists of even numbers. To be more accurate, however, we
to use function notation: need to specify a procedure for finding all the terms of the sequence. This can be done by
a giving a formula for the nth term an of the sequence. In this case,
so a11 2 ! 2, a11n2 22 ! 2n! 4, a13 2 ! 6, . . . an ! 2n

term term term term term
Notice how the formula an ! 2n gives all the terms of the sequence. For instance, substi-
tuting 1, 2, 3, and 4 for n gives the first four terms:
a1 ! 2 # 1 ! 2  a2 ! 2 # 2 ! 4
a3 ! 2 # 3 ! 6  a4 ! 2 # 4 ! 8
To find the 103rd term of this sequence, we use n ! 103 to get
a103 ! 2 # 103 ! 206
