1.8 COORDINATE GEOMETRY
The Coordinate Plane ! The Distance and Midpoint Formulas ! Graphs of
Equations in Two Variables ! Intercepts ! Circles ! Symmetry
The coordinate plane is the link between algebra and geometry. In the coordinate plane we
can draw graphs of algebraic equations. The graphs, in turn, allow us to "see" the relation-
ship between the variables in the equation. In this section we study the coordinate plane.
" The Coordinate Plane
The Cartesian plane is named in honor Just as points on a line can be identified with real numbers to form the coordinate line,
of the French mathematician René points in a plane can be identified with ordered pairs of numbers to form the coordi-

III, and IV in Figure 1. (The points on the coordinate axes are not assigned to any
quadrant.)

(a) The points whose x-coordinates are 0 or positive lie on the y-axis or to the right of
it, as shown in Figure 3(a).
(b) The set of all points with y-coordinate 1 is a horizontal line one unit above the 
x-axis, as in Figure 3(b).
