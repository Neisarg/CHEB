9.11 Segments from Secants and Tangents

Here you'll learn the relationship that exists between the segments that are created when a secant and tangent

intersect on a circle. You'll then use this relationship to solve for unknown circle values.

What if you were given a circle with a tangent and a secant that intersect outside the circle? How could you use

the length of some of the segments formed by their intersection to determine the lengths of the unknown segments?

After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the Tangent Secant Segment Theorem to solve problems like

this one.

Segments from Secants and Tangents CK-12

Guidance

If a tangent and secant meet at a common point outside a circle, the segments created have a similar relationship to

that of two secant rays.

Tangent Secant Segment Theorem: If a tangent and a secant are drawn from a common point outside the circle

(and the segments are labeled like the picture below), then a2 = b(b+ c).

Example A

Find the length of the missing segment.

Use the Tangent Secant Segment Theorem.

x2 = 4(4+12)

x2 = 4 ·16 = 64

x = 8

Example B

Fill in the blank and then solve for the missing segment.

= (4+5)

x2 = 4(4+5)

x2 = 36

x = 6

Example C

Find the value of the missing segment.

Use the Tangent Secant Segment Theorem.
202 = y(y+30)
400 = y2 +30y
0 = y2 +30y−400
0 = (y+40)(y−10)
y =H−4H0,10
