10.9 Arc Length

Here you'll learn how to use a circle's circumference to find the length of an arc.

What if you were given the angle measure of a circle's arc? How could you find the length of that arc? After

completing this Concept, you'll be able to find an arc's length, or its portion of a circle's circumference.

Arc Length CK-12

Guidance

One way to measure arcs is in degrees. This is called the "arc measure" or "degree measure" (see Arcs in Circles

). Arcs can also be measured in length, as a portion of the circumference. Arc length is the length of an arc or a

portion of a circle's circumference. The arc length is directly related to the degree arc measure.

Arc Length Formula: The length of ÂB = mÂB360◦ ·pid or mÂB360◦ ·2pir.

Example A

Find the length of P̂Q. Leave your answer in terms of pi.

In the picture, the central angle that corresponds with P̂Q is 60◦. This means that mP̂Q =(60◦. Think of the arc

length as a portion of the circumference. There are 360◦ in a circle, so 60◦ would be 1 60

6 . Therefore,

the length of P̂Q is 16 of the circumference. length of P̂Q =

6 ·2pi(9) = 3pi units.

Example B

The arc length of a circle is ÂB = 6pi and is 14 the circumference. Find the radius of the circle.

If 6pi is 14 the circumference, then the total circumference is 4(6pi) = 24pi. To find the radius, plug this into the

circumference formula and solve for r.

24pi= 2pir

12 units = r

Example C

Find the measure of the central angle or P̂Q.

Let's plug in what we know to the Arc Length Formula.

3. A typical large pizza has a diameter of 14 inches and is cut into 8 pieces. Think of the crust as the circumference
of the pizza. Find the length of the crust for the entire pizza. Then, find the length of the crust for one piece of pizza
if the entire pizza is cut into 8 pieces.
