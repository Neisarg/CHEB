1.1 Basic Geometric Definitions

Here you'll learn the basic geometric definitions and rules you will need to succeed in geometry.

What if you were given a picture of a figure or object, like a map with cities and roads marked on it? How could

you explain that picture geometrically? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to describe such a map using

geometric terms.

James Sousa: Definitions of and Postulates Involving Points, Lines, and Planes

Guidance

A point is an exact location in space. It describes a location, but has no size. Examples are shown below:

TABLE 1.1:

Label It Say It

A point A

2

www.ck12.org Chapter 1. Basics of Geometry

A line is infinitely many points that extend forever in both directions. Lines have direction and location and are

always straight.

TABLE 1.2:

Label It Say It

l←i→ne g line g

PQ line PQ

A plane is infinitely many intersecting lines that extend forever in all directions. Think of a plane as a huge sheet of

paper that goes on forever.

TABLE 1.3:

Label It Say It

Plane M Plane M

Plane ABC Plane ABC

We can use point, line, and plane to define new terms.

Space is the set of all points extending in three dimensions. Think back to the plane. It extended in two dimensions,

what we think of as up/down and left/right. If we add a third dimension, one that is perpendicular to the other two,

we arrive at three-dimensional space.

Points that lie on the same line are collinear. P,Q,R,S, and T are collinear because they are all on line w. If a point

U were located above or below line w, it would be non-collinear.

Points and/or line←s within the same plane are coplanar. Lines h and i and points A,B,C,D,G, and K are coplanar

in Plane J →. Line KF and point E are non-coplanar with Plane J .

1.1. Basic Geometric Definitions www.ck12.org
An endpoint is a point at the end of a line segment. A line segment is a portion of a line with two endpoints. Or, it
is a finite part of a line that stops at both ends. Line segments are labeled by their endpoints. Order does not matter.
TABLE 1.4:
Label It Say It
AB Segment AB
BA Segment BA
A ray is a part of a line with one endpoint that extends forever in one direction. A ray is labeled by its endpoint and
one other point on the ray. For rays, order does matter. When labeling, put the endpoint under the side WITHOUT
the arrow.
TABLE 1.5:
L−→abel It Say It
C←−D Ray CD
DC Ray CD
An intersection is a point or set of points where lines, planes, segments, or rays overlap.
Postulates
A postulate is a basic rule of geometry. Postulates are assumed to be true (rather than proven), much like definitions.
The following is a list of some basic postulates.
4
www.ck12.org Chapter 1. Basics of Geometry
Postulate #1: Given any two distinct points, there is exactly one (straight) line containing those two points.
Postulate #2: Given any three non-collinear points, there is exactly one plane containing those three points.
Postulate #3: If a line and a plane share two points, then the entire line lies within the plane.
Postulate #4: If two distinct lines intersect, the intersection will be one point.
Lines l and m intersect at point A.
Postulate #5: If two distinct planes intersect, the intersection will be a line.
When making geometric drawings, be sure to be clear and label all points and lines.

Example A
What best describes San Diego, California on a globe?
A. point
B. line
C. plane
Answer: A city is usually labeled with a dot, or point, on a globe.
Example B
Use the picture below to answer these questions.
a) List another way to label Plane J .
b) List another way to label line h.
c) Are K and F collinear?
d) Are E,B and F coplanar?
Answer:
a) Plane BDG is one possibility. Any combination of three coplanar points that are not collinear would be correct.
←→
b) AB. Any combination of two of the letters A,B, or C would also be correct.
←→
c) Yes, they both lie on KF .
d) Yes, even though E is not in Plane J , any three points make a distinct plane. Therefore, the three points create
Plane EBF .
Example C
What best describes a straight road connecting two cities?
A. ray
B. line
C. segment
D. plane
Answer: The straight road connects two cities, which are like endpoints. The best term is segment, or C.
