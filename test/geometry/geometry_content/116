11.3 Prisms

Here you'll learn what a prism is and how to find its volume and surface area.

What if you were given a solid three-dimensional figure with two congruent bases in which the other faces were

rectangles? How could you determine how much two-dimensional and three-dimensional space that figure occupies?

After completing this Concept, you'll be able to find the surface area and volume of a prism.

Guidance

A prism is a 3-dimensional figure with 2 congruent bases, in parallel planes, in which the other faces are rectangles.

The non-base faces are lateral faces. The edges between the lateral faces are lateral edges.

This particular example is a pentagonal prism because its base is a pentagon. Prisms are named by the shape of

their base. Prisms are classified as either right prisms (prisms where all the lateral faces are perpendicular to the

bases) or oblique prisms (prisms that lean to one side, whose base is a parallelogram rather than a rectangle, and

whose height is perpendicular to the base's plane), as shown below.

Surface Area

To find the surface area of a prism, find the sum of the areas of its faces. The lateral area is the sum of the areas of

the lateral faces. The basic unit of area is the square unit.

Sur f ace Area = B1 +B2 +L1 +L2 +L3

Lateral Area = L1 +L2 +L3

Volume

To find the volume of any solid you must figure out how much space it occupies. The basic unit of volume is the

cubic unit.

For prisms in particular, to find the volume you must find the area of the base and multiply it by the height.

Volume of a Prism: V = B ·h, where B =area of base.

If an oblique prism and a right prism have the same base area and height, then they will have the same volume. This

is due to Cavalieri's Principle, which states that if two solids have the same height and the same cross-sectional

area at every level, then they will have the same volume.

Example A

Find the surface area of the prism below.

Surface Area
To find the surface area of a prism, find the sum of the areas of its faces. The lateral area is the sum of the areas of
the lateral faces. The basic unit of area is the square unit.
Sur f ace Area = B1 +B2 +L1 +L2 +L3
Lateral Area = L1 +L2 +L3

area at every level, then they will have the same volume.

To solve, draw the net of the prism so that we can make sure we find the area of ALL faces.
Using the net, we have:
SAprism = 2(4)(10)+2(10)(17)+2(17)(4)
= 80+340+136
= 556 cm2
Example B
Find the surface area of the prism below.
This is a right triangular prism. To find the surface area, we need to find the length of the hypotenuse of the base
because it is the width of one of the lateral faces. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find this length.

72 +242 = c2
49+576 = c2
625 = c2 c = 25
Looking at the net, the surface area is:
( )
1
SA = 28(7)+28(24)+28(25)+2 ·7 ·24
2
SA = 196+672+700+168 = 1736 units2
Example C
You have a small, triangular prism-shaped tent. How much volume does it have once it is set up?
First, we need to find the area of the base.
1
B = (3)(4) = 6 f t2.
2
V = Bh = 6(7) = 42 f t3
Even though the height in this problem does not look like a "height," it is because it is the perpendicular segment
connecting the two bases.

Guided Practice
1. The total surface area of the triangular prism is 540 units2. What is x?
2. Find the volume of the right rectangular prism below.
3. A typical shoe box is 8 in by 14 in by 6 in. What is the volume of the box?
Answers:
1. The total surface area is equal to:
A√2 triangles +A3 rectangles = 540
The hypotenuse of the triangle bases is 13, 52 +122. Let's fill in what we know.
( )
1
A2 triangles = 2 ·5 ·12 = 602
A3 rectangles = 5x+12x+13x = 30x
60+30x = 540
30x = 480
x = 16 units The height is 16 units.

2. The area of the base is (5)(4) = 20 and the height is 3. So the total volume is (20)(3) = 60 units3
3. We can assume that a shoe box is a rectangular prism.
V = (8)(14)(6) = 672 in3
