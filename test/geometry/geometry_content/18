2.5 Conjectures and Counterexamples

Here you'll learn how to make educated guesses, or conjectures, based on patterns. You'll also learn how to disprove

conjectures with counterexamples.

Suppose you were given a mathematical pattern like h = −16/t2. What if you wanted to make an educated

guess, or conjecture, about h? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to make such a guess and provide

counterexamples that disprove incorrect guesses.

James Sousa: Counterexamples

Guidance

A conjecture is an "educated guess" that is based on examples in a pattern. A counterexample is an example that

disproves a conjecture.

Example A

Here's an algebraic equation and a table of values for n and t.

t = (n−1)(n−2)(n−3)

2.5. Conjectures and Counterexamples www.ck12.org

TABLE 2.1:

n (n−1)(n−2)(n−3) t

1 (0)(−1)(−2) 0

2 (1)(0)(−1) 0

3 (2)(1)(0) 0

After looking at the table, Pablo makes this conjecture:

The value of (n−1)(n−2)(n−3) is 0 for any number n.

Is this a true conjecture?

This is not a valid conjecture. If Pablo were to continue the table to n = 4, he would have see that (n−1)(n−2)(n−

3) = (4−1)(4−2)(4−3) = (3)(2)(1) = 6

In this example n = 4 is the counterexample.

Example B

Arthur is making figures for an art project. He drew polygons and some of their diagonals.

From these examples, Arthur made this conjecture:

If a convex polygon has n sides, then there are n−2 triangles formed when diagonals are drawn from any vertex of

the polygon.

Is Arthur's conjecture correct? Or, can you find a counterexample?

The conjecture appears to be correct. If Arthur draws other polygons, in every case he will be able to draw n− 2

triangles if the polygon has n sides.

Notice that we have not proved Arthur's conjecture, but only found several examples that hold true. So, at this

point, we say that the conjecture is true.

Example C

Give a counterexample to this statement: Every prime number is an odd number.

The only counterexample is the number 2: an even number (not odd) that is prime.

Guided Practice
A car salesman sold 5 used cars to five different couples. He noticed that each couple was under 30 years old. The
following day, he sold a new, luxury car to a couple in their 60's. The salesman determined that only younger couples
by used cars.
1. Is the salesman's conjecture logical? Why or why not?
2. Can you think of a counterexample?
Answers:
1. It is logical based on his experiences, but is not true.
2. A counterexample would be a couple that is 30 years old or older buying a used car.

3. All positive fractions are between 0 and 1.
4. Any three points that are coplanar are also collinear.

8. All teenagers can drive.
9. If n is an integer, then n > 0.
