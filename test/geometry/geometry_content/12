1.12 Polygon Classification

Here you'll learn how to classify a polygon based on its sides. You'll also learn how to decide whether a polygon is

convex or concave.

What if you were told how many sides a polygon has? How would you describe the polygon based on that

information? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to classify a polygon according to its shape and the

number of sides it has.

James Sousa: Classifying Polygons

Guidance

A polygon is any closed, 2-dimensional figure that is made entirely of line segments that intersect at their endpoints.

Polygons can have any number of sides and angles, but the sides can never be curved. The segments are called the

sides of the polygons, and the points where the segments intersect are called vertices.

1.12. Polygon Classification www.ck12.org

Polygons can be either convex or concave. The term concave refers to a cave, or the polygon is "caving in". All

stars are concave polygons.

A convex polygon does not cave in. Convex polygons look like:

A diagonal is a non-side line segment that connects two vertices of a convex polygon.

The red line segments are all diagonals. This pentagon has 5 diagonals.

Whether a polygon is convex or concave, it is always named by the number of sides. Explore the relationship

between the number of sides of a convex polygon and its diagonals. Can you complete the table?

Example A
Which of the figures below is a polygon?
The easiest way to identify the polygon is to identify which shapes are not polygons. B and C each have at least one
curved side, so they are not be polygons. D has all straight sides, but one of the vertices is not at the endpoint, so it
is not a polygon. A is the only polygon.
Example B
Determine if the shapes below are convex or concave.
To see if a polygon is concave, look at the polygons and see if any angle "caves in" to the interior of the polygon.
The first polygon does not do this, so it is convex. The other two do, so they are concave.
Example C
Name the three polygons below by their number of sides and if it is convex or concave.
The pink polygon is a concave hexagon (6 sides).
The green polygon convex pentagon (5 sides).

The yellow polygon is a convex decagon (10 sides).

Guided Practice
1. Which of the figures below is not a polygon?
2. How many diagonals does a 7-sided polygon have?
3. True or false: A quadrilateral is always a square.
Answers:
1. C is a three-dimensional shape, so it does not lie within one plane, so it is not a polygon.
2. Draw a 7-sided polygon, also called a heptagon.
Drawing in all the diagonals and counting them, we see there are 14.
3. False. Only quadrilaterals with four congruent sides and four right angles will be squares. There are many
quadrilaterals (such as rectangles, kites, parallelograms, trapezoids, etc.) that are not necessarily squares.

Summary
This chapter begins with the basic components of Euclidean Geometry. From the introductory definition of points,
lines, and planes it builds to a discussion of classifying figures such as angles, triangles, and polygons. Measurement
of distances and angles are also covered. Different types of angle relationships are compared and explored, such as
complementary angles, supplementary angles and linear pairs.
