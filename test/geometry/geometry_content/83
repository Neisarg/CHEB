8.6 30-60-90 Right Triangles

√

Here you'll learn that the sides of a 30-60-90 right triangle are in the ratio x : x 3 : 2x.

What if you were given a 30-60-90 right triangle and the length of one of its side? How could you figure out the

lengths of its other sides? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the 30-60-90 Theorem to solve

problems like this one.

James Sousa: Solving Special Right Triangles

Guidance

One of the two special right triangles is called a 30-60-90 triangle, after its three angles. √

30-60-90 Theorem: If a triangle has angle measures 30◦,60◦ and 90◦, then the sides are in the ratio x : x 3 : 2x.

√

The shorter leg is always x, the longer leg is always x 3, and the hypotenuse is always 2x. If you ever forget these

theorems, you can still use the Pythagorean Theorem.

Example A

Find the length of the missing side.

√

We are given the shorter leg. If x = 5, then the longer leg, b = 5 3, and the hypotenuse, c = 2(5) = 10.

Example B

Find the length of the missing side.

√

We are given the hypotenuse. 2x = 20, so the shorter leg, f = 202 = 10, and the longer leg, g = 10 3.

Example C

√

A rectangle has sides 4 and 4 3. What is the length of the diagonal?

If you are not given a picture, draw one.

√

The two lengths are x,x 3, so the diagonal would be 2x, or 2(4) = 8.

If you did not recognize this is a 30-60-90 triangle, you can use the Pythagorean Theorem too.
