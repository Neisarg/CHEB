6.2 Exterior Angles in Convex Polygons

Here you'll learn the Exterior Angle Sum Theorem that states that the exterior angles of a polygon always add up to

360◦.

What if you were given a seven-sided regular polygon? How could you determine the measure of each of its exterior

angles? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the Exterior Angle Sum Theorem to solve problems

like this one.

James Sousa: Angles of Convex Polygons

Guidance

An exterior angle is an angle that is formed by extending a side of the polygon.

As you can see, there are two sets of exterior angles for any vertex on a polygon, one going around clockwise (1st

hexagon), and the other going around counter-clockwise (2nd hexagon). The angles with the same colors are vertical

and congruent.

The Exterior Angle Sum Theorem states that the sum of the exterior angle◦s of ANY convex polygon is 360

◦. If

the polygon is regular with n sides, this means that each exterior angle is 360n .

Example A

What is y?

y is an exterior angle and all the given angles add up to 360◦. Set up an equation.

70◦+60◦+65◦+40◦+ y = 360◦

y = 125◦

Example B

What is the measure of each exterior angle of a regular heptagon?

Because the polygon is regular, the interior angles are equal. It also means the exterior angles are equal. 360

◦

7 ≈

51.43◦

Example C

What is the sum of the exterior angles in a regular 15-gon?

The sum of the exterior angles in any convex polygon, including a regular 15-gon, is 360◦.
