7.6 SSS Similarity

Here you'll learn how to determine if triangles are similar using Side-Side-Side (SSS).

What if you were given a pair of triangles and the side lengths for all three of their sides? How could you use this

information to determine if the two triangles are similar? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the

SSS Similarity Theorem to decide if two triangles are congruent.

James Sousa: Similar Triangles Using SSS andSAS

Guidance

By definition, two triangles are similar if all their corresponding angles are congruent and their corresponding sides

are proportional. It is not necessary to check all angles and sides in order to tell if two triangles are similar. In fact, if

www.ck12.org Chapter 7. Similarity

you know only that all sides are proportional, that is enough information to know that the triangles are similar. This

is called the SSS Similarity Theorem.

SSS Similarity Theorem: If all three pairs of corresponding sides of two triangles are proportional, then the two

triangles are similar.

If ABY Z =

BC

ZX =

AC

XY , then4ABC ∼4Y ZX .

Example A

Determine if the following triangles are similar. If so, explain why and write the similarity statement.

We will need to find the ratios for the corresponding sides of the triangles and see if they are all the same. Start with

the longest sides and work down to the shortest sides.

Since all the ratios are the same,4ABC ∼4EFD by the SSS Similarity Theorem.

According to the similarity statement, the corresponding sides are: ABDE =
