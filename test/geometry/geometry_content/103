Guidance

A parallelogram is a quadrilateral whose opposite sides are parallel.

To find the area of a parallelogram, make it into a rectangle.

From this, we see that the area of a parallelogram is the same as the area of a rectangle. The area of a parallelogram

is A = bh. The height of a parallelogram is always perpendicular to the base. This means that the sides are not the

height.

Example A

Find the area of the parallelogram.

A = 15 ·8 = 120 in2

Example B

If the area of a parallelogram is 56 units2 and the base is 4 units, what is the height?

Solve for the height in A = bh.

56 units = 4h

14 units = h

Example C

If the height of a parallelogram is 12 m and the area is 60 m2, how wide is the base?

Solve for the base in A = bh.

60 units = 12b

5 units = b
