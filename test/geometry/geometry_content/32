3.11 Distance Between Parallel Lines

Here you'll learn that the shortest distance between two parallel lines is the length of a perpendicular line between

them.

What if you were given two parallel lines? How could you find how far apart these two lines are? After completing

this Concept, you'll be able to find the distance between two vertical lines, two horizontal lines, and two non-vertical,

non-horizontal parallel lines using the perpendicular slope.

James Sousa: Determining the Distance Between Two Parallel Lines

Guidance

All vertical lines are in the form x = a, where a is the x−intercept. To find the distance between two vertical lines,

count the squares between the two lines. You can use this method for horizontal lines as well. All horizontal lines

are in the form y = b, where b is the y− intercept.

In general, the shortest distance between two parallel lines is the length of a perpendicular line between them. There

are infinitely many perpendicular lines between two parallel lines, but they will all be the same length.

Remember that distances are always positive!

Example A

Find the distance between x = 3 and x =−5.

The two lines are 3 -(-5) units apart, or 8 units apart.

Example B

Find the distance between y = 5 and y =−8.

The two lines are 5 -(-8) units apart, or 13 units apart.

Example C
Find the distance between y = x+6 and y = x−2.
Step 1: Find the perpendicular slope.
m = 1, so m⊥ =−1
Step 2: Find the y−intercept of the top line, y = x+6. (0, 6)
Step 3: Use the slope and count down 1 and to the right 1 until you hit y = x−2.
Always rise/run the same amount for m = 1 or -1.
Step 4: Use these two points in the distance formula to determine how far apart the lines are.

Summary
This chapter begins by comparing parallel and skew lines and presenting some of the basic properties of parallel
lines. Perpendicular lines are then introduced and some basic properties and theorems related to perpendicular lines
are explored. Building on the discussion of parallel lines, perpendicular lines, and transversals, the different angles
formed when parallel lines are cut by a transversal are displayed. Corresponding angles, alternate interior angles,
alternate exterior angles and their properties are presented. The algebra topics of equations of lines, slope, and
distance are tied to the geometric concepts of parallel and perpendicular lines.
