12.4 Rotations

Here you'll learn what a rotation is and how to find the coordinates of a rotated figure.

What if you were given the coordinates of a quadrilateral and you were asked to rotate that quadrilateral 270◦ about

the origin? What would its new coordinates be? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to rotate a figure like

this one in the coordinate plane.

Guidance

A transformation is an operation that moves, flips, or otherwise changes a figure to create a new figure. A rigid

transformation (also known as an isometry or congruence transformation) is a transformation that does not

change the size or shape of a figure.

The rigid transformations are translations (discussed elsewhere), reflections (discussed elsewhere), and rotations

(discussed here). The new figure created by a transformation is called the image. The original figure is called the

preimage. If the preimage is A, then the image would be A′, said "a prime." If there is an image of A′, that would be

labeled A′′, said "a double prime."

A rotation is a transformation where a figure is turned around a fixed point to create an image. The lines drawn

from the preimage to the center of rotation and from the center of rotation to the image form the angle of rotation.

In this concept, we will only do counterclockwise rotations.

While we can rotate any image any amount of degrees, 90◦,180◦ and 270◦ rotations are common and have rules

worth memorizing.

Rotation of 180◦: (x,y)→ (−x,−y)

Rotation of 90◦: (x,y)→ (−y,x)

Rotation of 270◦: (x,y)→ (y,−x)

Example A

A rotation of 80◦ clockwise is the same as what counterclockwise rotation?

There are 360◦ around a point. So, an 80◦ rotation clockwise is the same as a 360◦− 80◦ = 280◦ rotation counter-

clockwise.

Example B

A rotation of 160◦ counterclockwise is the same as what clockwise rotation?

Rotation of 90◦: (x,y)→ (−y,x)
Rotation of 270◦: (x,y)→ (y,−x)
Example A
A rotation of 80◦ clockwise is the same as what counterclockwise rotation?
There are 360◦ around a point. So, an 80◦ rotation clockwise is the same as a 360◦− 80◦ = 280◦ rotation counter-
clockwise.
Example B
A rotation of 160◦ counterclockwise is the same as what clockwise rotation?

360◦−160◦ = 200◦ clockwise rotation.
Example C
Rotate4ABC, with vertices A(7,4),B(6,1), and C(3,1), 180◦ about the origin. Find the coordinates of4A′B′C′.
Use the rule above to find4A′B′C′.
A(7,4)→ A′(−7,−4)
B(6,1)→ B′(−6,−1)
C(3,1)→C′(−3,−1)

2. Using the rule, we have:
(x,y)→ (y,−x)
A(−4,5)→ A′(5,4)
B(1,2)→ B′(2,−1)
C(−6,−2)→C′(−2,6)
D(−8,3)→ D′(3,8)
3. Because a rotation produces congruent figures, we can set up two equations to solve for x and y.
2y = 80◦ 2x−3 = 15
y = 40◦ 2x = 18
x = 9
