11.8 Composite Solids

Here you'll learn what a composite solid is and how to find its volume and surface area.

What if you built a solid three-dimensional house model consisting of a pyramid on top of a square prism? How could

you determine how much two-dimensional and three-dimensional space that model occupies? After completing this

Concept, you'll be able to find the surface area and volume of composite solids like this one.

Guidance

A composite solid is a solid that is composed, or made up of, two or more solids. The solids that it is made up

of are generally prisms, pyramids, cones, cylinders, and spheres. In order to find the surface area and volume of a

composite solid, you need to know how to find the surface area and volume of prisms, pyramids, cones, cylinders,

and spheres. For more information on any of those specific solids, consult the concept that focuses on them. This

concept will assume knowledge of those five solids.

Most composite solids problems that you will see will be about volume, so most of the examples and practice

problems below are about volume. There is one surface area example as well.

Example A

Find the volume of the solid below.

This solid is a parallelogram-based prism with a cylinder cut out of the middle.

Vprism = (25 ·25)30 = 18,750 cm3

Vcylinder = pi(4)2(30) = 480pi cm3

www.ck12.org Chapter 11. Surface Area and Volume

The total volume is 18750−480pi≈ 17,242.04 cm3.

Example B

Find the volume of the composite solid. All bases are squares.

This is a square prism with a square √pyramid on top. First, we need the height of the pyramid portion. Using the

Pythagorean Theorem, we have, h = 252−242 = 7.

Vprism = (48)(48)(18) = 41,472 cm3

1

Vpyramid = (482)(7) = 5376 cm33

The total volume is 41,472+5376 = 46,848 cm3.

Example C

Find the surface area of the following solid.

This solid is a cylinder with a hemisphere on top. It is one solid, so do not include the bottom of the hemisphere or

the top of the cylinder.

SA = LAcylinder +LAhemisphere +Abase circle

1

= 2pirh+ 4pir2 +pir2

2

= 2pi(6)(13)+2pi62 +pi62

= 156pi+72pi+36pi

= 264pi in2

Guided Practice
1. Find the volume of the following solid.
2. Find the volume of the base prism. Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.
3. Using your work from #2, find the volume of the pyramid and then of the entire solid.
Answers:
1. Use what you know about cylinders and spheres. The top of the solid is a hemisphere.
Vcylinder = pi6(2(13) =)468pi
1 4
Vhemisphere = pi63 = 144pi2 3
Vtotal = 468pi+144pi= 612pi in3

2. Use what you know about prisms.
Vprism = B ·h
Vprism = (4 ·4) ·5
Vprism = 80in3
3. Use what you know about pyramids.

Vpyramid = B ·h3
1
Vpyramid = (4 ·4)(6)3
Vpyramid = 32in3
Now find the total volume by finding the sum of the volumes of each solid.
Vtotal =Vprism +Vpyramid
Vtotal = 112in3
