9.4 Chords in Circles

Here you'll learn four theorems about chords in circles and how to apply them to find missing values.

What if you were given a circle with two chords drawn through it? How could you determine if these two chords

were congruent? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use four chord theorems to solve problems like

this one.

Guidance

There are several important theorems about chords that will help you to analyze circles better.

1) Chord Theorem #1: In the same circle or congruent circles, minor arcs are congruent if and only if their

corresponding chords are congruent.

In both of these pictures, BE ∼=CD and B̂E ∼= ĈD.

2) Chord Theorem #2: The perpendicular bisector of a chord is also a diameter.

www.ck12.org Chapter 9. Circles

If AD⊥ BC and BD∼= DC then EF is a diameter.

3) Chord Theorem #3: If a diameter is perpendicular to a chord, then the diameter bisects the chord and its

corresponding arc.

If EF ⊥ BC, then BD∼= DC and B̂E ∼= ÊC.

4) Chord Theorem #4: In the same circle or congruent circles, two chords are congruent if and only if they are

equidistant from the center.

The shortest distance from any point to a line is the perpendicular line between them. If FE = EG and EF ⊥ EG,

then AB and CD are equidistant to the center and AB∼=CD.

If EF ⊥ BC, then BD∼= DC and B̂E ∼= ÊC.
4) Chord Theorem #4: In the same circle or congruent circles, two chords are congruent if and only if they are
equidistant from the center.
The shortest distance from any point to a line is the perpendicular line between them. If FE = EG and EF ⊥ EG,
then AB and CD are equidistant to the center and AB∼=CD.

a) If mB̂D = 125◦, find mĈD.
b) If mB̂C = 80◦, find mĈD.
Answers:
a) BD =CD, which means the arcs are congruent too. mĈD = 125◦.
b) mĈD∼= mB̂D because BD =CD.
mB̂C+mĈD+mB̂D = 360◦
80◦+2mĈD = 360◦
2mĈD = 280◦
mĈD = 140◦
Example B
Find the values of x and y.
The diameter is perpendicular to the chord. From Chord Theorem #3, x = 6 and y = 75◦.
Example C
Find the value of x.
488
www.ck12.org Chapter 9. Circles
Because the distance from the center to the chords is equal, the chords are congruent.

1. Find the value of x and y.
⊙
2. BD = 12 and AC = 3 in A. Find the radius.
3. Find mB̂D from #2.
Answers:
1. The diameter is perpendicular to the chord, which means it bisects the chord and the arc. Set up equations for x
and y.

(3x−4)◦ = (5x−18)◦ y+4 = 2y+1
14 = 2x 3 = y
7 = x
2. First find the radius. AB is a radius, so we can use the right triangle 4ABC with hypotenuse AB. From Chord
Theorem #3, BC = 6.
32 +62 = AB2
9+36 = A√B

AB = 45 = 3 5
3. First, find the corresponding central angle, 6 BAD. We can find m6 BAC using the tangent ratio. Then, multiply
m6 BAC by 2 for m 6 BAD and mB̂D.
( )

m6 BAC ≈ 63.43◦
m6 BAD≈ 2 ·63.43◦ ≈ 126.86◦ ≈ mB̂D
