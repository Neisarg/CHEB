1.10 Vertical Angles

Here you'll learn what vertical angles are and how to solve vertical angle problems.

What if you were given two angles of unknown size and were told they are vertical angles? How would you

determine their angle measures? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the definition of vertical angles

to solve problems like this one.

Vertical angles are two non-adjacent angles formed by intersecting lines. 6 1 and 6 3 are vertical angles and 6 2 and

6 4 are vertical angles.

The Vertical Angles Theorem states that if two angles are vertical angles, then they are congruent.

Example A

Find m 6 1.

6 1 is vertical angles with 18◦, so m6 1 = 18◦.

Example B

If 6 ABC and 6 DEF are vertical angles and m 6 ABC = (4x+10)◦ and m6 DEF = (5x+2)◦, what is the measure of

each angle?

Vertical angles are congruent, so set the angles equal to each other and solve for x. Then go back to find the measure

of each angle.

4x+10 = 5x+2

x = 8

So, m 6 ABC = m6 DEF = (4(8)+10)◦ = 42◦

Example C

True or false: vertical angles are always less than 90◦.

This is false, you can have vertical angles that are more than 90◦. Vertical angles are less than 180◦.

The Vertical Angles Theorem states that if two angles are vertical angles, then they are congruent.
Example A
Find m 6 1.
6 1 is vertical angles with 18◦, so m6 1 = 18◦.
Example B
If 6 ABC and 6 DEF are vertical angles and m 6 ABC = (4x+10)◦ and m6 DEF = (5x+2)◦, what is the measure of
each angle?
Vertical angles are congruent, so set the angles equal to each other and solve for x. Then go back to find the measure
of each angle.
4x+10 = 5x+2
x = 8
So, m 6 ABC = m6 DEF = (4(8)+10)◦ = 42◦
Example C
True or false: vertical angles are always less than 90◦.
This is false, you can have vertical angles that are more than 90◦. Vertical angles are less than 180◦.

Answers:
1. Vertical angles are congruent, so set the angles equal to each other and solve for x.
x+16 = 4x−5
3x = 21
x = 7◦
2. Vertical angles are congruent, so set the angles equal to each other and solve for y.
9y+7 = 2y+98
7y = 91
y = 13◦
3. Vertical angles are congruent, so set the angles equal to each other and solve for y.
11y−36 = 63
11y = 99
y = 9◦
