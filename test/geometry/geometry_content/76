7.13 Self-Similarity

Here you'll learn what it means for an object to be self-similar and you'll be introduced to some common examples

of self-similarity.

What if you were given an object, like a triangle or a snowflake, in which a part of it could be enlarged (or shrunk)

to look like the whole object? What would each successive iteration of that object look like? After completing this

Concept, you'll be able to use the idea of self-similarity to answer questions like this one.

Guidance

When one part of an object can be enlarged (or shrunk) to look like the whole object it is self-similar.

To explore self-similarity, we will go through some examples. Typically, each step of a process is called an iteration.

The first level is called Stage 0.

Example A (Sierpinski Triangle)

The Sierpinski triangle iterates a triangle by connecting the midpoints of the sides and shading the central triangle

(Stage 1). Repeat this process for the unshaded triangles in Stage 1 to get Stage 2.

Example B (Fractals)

Like the Sierpinski triangle, a fractal is another self-similar object that is repeated at smaller scales. Below are the

first three stages of the Koch snowflake.

Example C (The Cantor Set)

The Cantor set is another example of a fractal. It consists of dividing a segment into thirds and then erasing the

middle third.

Guided Practice

1. Determine the number of edges and the perimeter of each snowflake shown in Example B. Assume that the length

of one side of the original (stage 0) equilateral triangle is 1.

2. Determine the number of shaded and unshaded triangles in each stage of the Sierpinkski triangle. Determine if

there is a pattern.

3. Determine the number of segments in each stage of the Cantor Set. Is there a pattern?

TABLE 7.4:
Stage 0 Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3
Unshaded 1 3 9 27
Shaded 0 1 4 13
The number of unshaded triangles seems to be powers of 3 : 30,31,32,33, . . .. The number of shaded triangles is
the sum the number of shaded and unshaded triangles from the previous stage. For Example, the number of shaded
triangles in Stage 4 would equal 27 + 13 = 40.
3. Starting from Stage 0, the number of segments is 1,2,4,8,16, . . .. These are the powers of 2. 20,21,22, . . ..

3. How many segments are in Stage n?
4. Draw Stage 3 of the Koch snowflake.
5. A variation on the Sierpinski triangle is the Sierpinski carpet, which splits a square into 9 equal squares,
coloring the middle one only. Then, split the uncolored squares to get the next stage. Draw the first 3 stages
of this fractal.
6. How many colored vs. uncolored square are in each stage?
7. Fractals are very common in nature. For example, a fern leaf is a fractal. As the leaves get closer to the end,
they get smaller and smaller. Find three other examples of fractals in nature.

Summary
This chapter is all about proportional relationships. It begins by introducing the concept of ratio and proportion
and detailing properties of proportions. It then takes these arithmetic and algebraic relationships and connects them
to the geometric relationships of similar polygons. Applications of similar polygons and scale factors are covered.
The AA, SSS, and SAS methods of determining similar triangles are presented and the Triangle Proportionality
Theorem is explored. The chapter wraps up with the proportional relationships formed when parallel lines are cut
by a transversal, similarity and dilated figures, and self-similarity.
