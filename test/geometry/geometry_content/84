8.7 Sine, Cosine, Tangent

Here you'll learn what the three trigonometric ratios are and how to find their value for a right triangle's non-right

angle.

What if you were given a right triangle and told that its sides measure 3, 4, and 5 inches? How could you find the

sine, cosine, and tangent of one of the triangle's non-right angles? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to

solve for these trigonometric ratios.

Guidance

Trigonometry is the study of the relationships between the sides and angles of right triangles. The legs are called

adjacent or opposite depending on which acute angle is being used.

a is ad jacent to 6 B a is opposite 6 A

b is ad jacent to 6 A b is opposite 6 B

c is the hypotenuse

The three basic trigonometric ratios are called sine, cosine and tangent. For right triangle4ABC, we have:

Sine Ratio: opposite leghypotenuse sinA =

a

c or sinB =

b

c

Cosine Ratio: ad jacent leghypotenuse cosA =

b

c or cosB =

a

c

Tangent Ratio: opposite legad jacent leg tanA =

a

b or tanB =

b

a

An easy way to remember ratios is to use SOH-CAH-TOA.

A few important points:

• Always reduce ratios (fractions) when you can.

• Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing side (if there is one).

• If there is a radical in the denominator, rationalize the denominator.

Example A

Find the sine, cosine and tangent ratios of 6 A.

First, we need to use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse.

52 +122 = c2

13 = c

leg opposite 6 A 12 leg ad jacent to 6 A 5

sinA = = cosA = = ,

hypotenuse 13 hypotenuse 13

leg opposite 6 A 12

tanA = =

leg ad jacent to 6 A 5

Example B

Find the sine, cosine, and tangent of 6 B.
