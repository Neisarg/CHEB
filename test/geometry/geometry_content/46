5.1 Midsegment Theorem

Here you'll learn what a midsegment is and how to use the Midsegment Theorem.

What if you were given 4FGH and told that JK was its midsegment? How could you find the length of JK given

the length of the triangle's third side, FH? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the Midsegment

Theorem to solve problems like this one.

James Sousa: Determining Unknown Values Using Properties of the Midsegments of a Triangle

Guidance

A line segment that connects two midpoints of the sides of a triangle is called a midsegment. DF is the midsegment

between AB and BC.

www.ck12.org Chapter 5. Triangle Relationships

The tic marks show that D and F are midpoints. AD ∼= DB and BF ∼= FC. For every triangle there are three

midsegments.

There are two important properties of midsegments that combine to make the Midsegment Theorem. The Midseg-

ment Theorem states that the midsegment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third

side of the triangle, and the length of this midsegment is half the length of the third side. So, if DF is a midsegment

of4ABC, then DF = 12 AC = AE = EC and DF‖AC.

Note that there are two important ideas here. One is that the midsegment is parallel to a side of the triangle. The

other is that the midsegment is always half the length of this side. To play with the properties of midsegments, go to

Example A

The vertices of4LMN are L(4,5), M(−2,−7) and N(−8,3). Find the midpoints of all three sides, label them O, P

and Q. Then, graph the triangle, plot the midpoints and draw the midsegments.

To(solve this problem, use the midpoint formula 3 times to find all the midpoints. Recall that the midpoint formula

Example B
Mark all the congruent segments on4ABC with midpoints D, E, and F .
Drawing in all three midsegments, we have:
Also, this means the four smaller triangles are congruent by SSS.
Now, mark all the parallel lines on4ABC, with midpoints D, E, and F .

Example C
M, N, and O are the midpoints of the sides of4XY Z.
Find
a) MN
b) XY
c) The perimeter of4XY Z
To solve, use the Midsegment Theorem.
a) MN = OZ = 5
b) XY = 2(ON) = 2 ·4 = 8
c) Add up the three sides of4XY Z to find the perimeter.
XY +Y Z +XZ = 2 ·4+2 ·3+2 ·5 = 8+6+10 = 24
Remember: No line segment over MN means length or distance.

Guided Practice
1. Find the value of x and AB. A and B are midpoints.
239
5.1. Midsegment Theorem www.ck12.org
2. True or false: If a line passes through two sides of a triangle and is parallel to the third side, then it is a midsegment.
3. Find y. You may assume that the line segment within the triangle is a midsegment.
Answers:
1. AB = 34÷2 = 17. To find x, set 3x−1 equal to 17.
3x−1 = 17
3x = 18
x = 6
2. This statement is false. A line that passes through two sides of a triangle is only a midsegment if it passes through
the midpoints of the two sides of the triangle.
3. Because a midsegment is always half the length of the side it is parallel to, we know that y = 12(36) = 18.
