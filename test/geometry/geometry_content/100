9.12 Circles in the Coordinate Plane

Here you'll learn how to find the standard equation for circles given their radius and center. You'll also graph circles

in the coordinate plane.

What if you were given the length of the radius of a circle and the coordinates of its center? How could you write

the equation of the circle in the coordinate plane? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to write the standard

equation of a circle.

James Sousa: Write the Standard Form of a Circle

Guidance

Recall that a circle is the set of all points in a plane that are the same distance from the center. This definition can be

used to find an equation of a circle in the coordinate plane.

www.ck12.org Chapter 9. Circles

Let's start with the circle centered at (0, 0). If (x,y) is a point on the circle, then the distance from the center to this

point would be the radius, r. x is the horizontal distance and y is the vertical distance. This forms a right triangle.

From the Pythagorean Theorem, the equation of a circle centered at the origin is x2 + y2 = r2.

The center does not always have to be on (0, 0). If it is not, then we label the center (h,k). We would then use the

Distance Formula to find the length of the radius.

√

r = (x−h)2 +(y− k)2

If you square both sides of this equation, then you would have the standard equation of a circle. The standard

equation of a circle with center (h,k) and radius r is r2 = (x−h)2 +(y− k)2.

Example A

Graph x2 + y2 = 9.

The center is (0, 0). Its radius is the square root of 9, or 3. Plot the center, plot the points that are 3 units to the right,

left, up, and down from the center and then connect these four points to form a circle.

Example B

Find the equation of the circle below.

r = (x−h)2 +(y− k)2
If you square both sides of this equation, then you would have the standard equation of a circle. The standard
equation of a circle with center (h,k) and radius r is r2 = (x−h)2 +(y− k)2.

First locate the center. Draw in the horizontal and vertical diameters to see where they intersect.
From this, we see that the center is (-3, 3). If we count the units from the center to the circle on either of these
diameters, we find r = 6. Plugging this into the equation of a circle, we get: (x− (−3))2 + (y− 3)2 = 62 or
(x+3)2 +(y−3)2 = 36.
Example C
Determine if the following points are on (x+1)2 +(y−5)2 = 50.
a) (8, -3)
b) (-2, -2)
Plug in the points for x and y in (x+1)2 +(y−5)2 = 50.
a)
(8+1)2 +(−3−5)2 = 50
92 +(−8)2 = 50
81+64 6= 50
(8, -3) is not on the circle
b)
(−2+1)2 +(−2−5)2 = 50
(−1)2 +(−7)2 = 50
1+49 = 50

Guided Practice
Find the center and radius of the following circles.
1. (x−3)2 +(y−1)2 = 25
2. (x+2)2 +(y−5)2 = 49
3. Find the equation of the circle with center (4, -1) and which passes through (-1, 2).
Answers:
1. Rewrite the equation as (x−3)2 +(y−1)2 = 52. The center is (3, 1) and r = 5.
2. Rewrite the equation as (x− (−2))2 +(y−5)2 = 72. The center is (-2, 5) and r = 7.
Keep in mind that, due to the minus signs in the formula, the coordinates of the center have the opposite signs of
what they may initially appear to be.
3. First plug in the center to the standard equation.
(x−4)2 +(y− (−1))2 = r2
(x−4)2 +(y+1)2 = r2
Now, plug in (-1, 2) for x and y and solve for r.
(−1−4)2 +(2+1)2 = r2
(−5)2 +(3)2 = r2
25+9 = r2
34 = r2
Substituting in 34 for r2, the equation is (x−4)2 +(y+1)2 = 34.

Summary
This chapter begins with vocabulary associated with the parts of circles. It then branches into theorems about tangent
lines; properties of arcs and central angles; and theorems about chords and how to apply them. Inscribed angles and
inscribed quadrilaterals and their properties are explored. Angles on, inside, and outside a circle are presented
in detail and the subsequent relationships are used in problem solving. Relationships among chords, secants, and
tangents are discovered and applied. The chapter ends with the connection between algebra and geometry as the
equations of circles are discussed.
