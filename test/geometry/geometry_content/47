5.2 Perpendicular Bisectors

Here you'll learn what a perpendicular bisector is and the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem, which states that if a

point is on the perpendicular bisector of a segment, then it is equidistant from the endpoints of the segment.

←→

What if you were given 4FGH and told that GJ was the perpendicular bisector of FH? How could you find the

length of FG given the length of GH? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the Perpendicular Bisector

Theorem to solve problems like this one.

A perpendicular bisector is a line that intersects a line segment at its midpoint and is perpendicular to that line

segment, as shown in the construction below.

One important property related to perpendicular bisectors is that if a point is on the perpendicular bisector of a

segment, then it is equidistant from the endpoints of the segment. This is called the Perpendicular Bisector

Theorem.

←→

If CD⊥ AB and AD = DB, then AC =CB.

In addition to the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem, the converse is also true.

Perpendicular Bisector Theorem Converse: If a point is equidistant from the endpoints of a segment, then the
point is on the perpendicular bisector of the segment.
←→
Using the picture above: If AC =CB, then CD⊥ AB and AD = DB.
When we construct perpendicular bisectors for the sides of a triangle, they meet in one point. This point is called the
circumcenter of the triangle.
Example A
←→
If MO is the perpendicular bisector of LN and LO = 8, what is ON?
By the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem, LO = ON. So, ON = 8.
Example B
Find x and the length of each segment.
←→
WX is the perpendicular bisector of XZ and from the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem WZ =WY .
2x+11 = 4x−5
16 = 2x
8 = x
245
5.2. Perpendicular Bisectors www.ck12.org
WZ =WY = 2(8)+11 = 16+11 = 27.
Example C
Find the value of x. m is the perpendicular bisector of AB.
By the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem, both segments are equal. Set up and solve an equation.
3x−8 = 2x
x = 8
