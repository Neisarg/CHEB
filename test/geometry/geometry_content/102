10.1 Area and Perimeter of Rectangles

Here you'll learn how to find the area and perimeter of a rectangle given its base and height.

What if you were given a rectangle and the size of its base and height? How could you find the total distance around

the rectangle and the amount of space it takes up? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the formulas

for the perimeter and area of a rectangle to solve problems like this.

Guidance

To find the area of a rectangle, calculate A = bh, where b is the base (width) and h is the height (length). The

perimeter of a rectangle will always be P = 2b+2h.

If a rectangle is a square, with sides of length s, then perimeter is Psquare = 2s+2s = 4s and area is Asqaure = s ·s = s2.

Example A

Find the area and perimeter of a rectangle with sides 4 cm by 9 cm.

The perimeter is 4+9+4+9 = 26 cm. The area is A = 9 ·4 = 36 cm2.

Example B

Find the area and perimeter of a square with side 5 in.

The perimeter is 4(5) = 20in and the area is 52 = 25 in2.

Example C

Find the area and perimeter of a rectangle with sides 13 m and 12 m.

The perimeter is 2(13)+2(12) = 50 m. The area is 13(12) = 156 m2.

Guided Practice

1. The area of a square is 75 in2. Find the perimeter.

2. Draw two different rectangles with an area of 36 cm2.

3. Find the area and perimeter of a rectangle with sides 7 in and 10 in.

Answers:

1. To find the perimeter, we need to find the length of the sides.

A = s2√= 75 in

2
