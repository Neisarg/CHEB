10.6 Area and Perimeter of Rhombuses and

Kites

Here you'll learn how to find the area and perimeter of a kite or a rhombus given its two diagonals.

What if you were given a kite or a rhombus and the size of its two diagonals? How could you find the total distance

around the kite or rhombus and the amount of space it takes up? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use

the formulas for the perimeter and area of a kite/rhombus to solve problems like this.

Guidance

Recall that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with four congruent sides and a kite is a quadrilateral with distinct adjacent

congruent sides. Both of these quadrilaterals have perpendicular diagonals, which is how we are going to find their

areas.

Notice that the diagonals divide each quadrilateral into 4 triangles. If we move the two triangles on the bottom

of each quadrilateral so that they match up with the triangles above the horizontal diagonal, we would have two

rectangles.

So, the height of these rectangles is half of one of the diagonals and the base is the length of the other diagonal.

The area of a rhombus or a kite is A = 12 d1d2

Example A

Find the perimeter and area of the rhombus below.

In a rhombus, all four triangles created by the diagonals are congruent.

To find the perimeter, you must find the length of each side, which would be the hypotenuse of one of the four

triangles. Use the Pythagorean Theorem.

In a rhombus, all four triangles created by the diagonals are congruent.
Here, each triangle is a 30√-60-90 triangle with a hypotenuse of 14. From the special right triangle ratios the short leg
is 7 and the long leg is 7 3.

Example C
The vertices of a quadrilateral are A(2,8),B(7,9),C(11,2), and D(3,3). Show ABCD is a kite and find its area.
After plotting the points, it looks like a kite. AB = AD and BC = DC. The diagonals are perpendicular if the slopes
are negative reciprocals of each other.

The diagonals are perpendicular, so ABCD is a kite. To find the area, we need to find the length of the diagonals, AC
and BD.

Answers:
In a kite, there are two pairs of congruent triangles. Use the Pythagorean Theorem in the first two problems to find
the lengths of sides or diagonals.
