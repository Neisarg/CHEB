11.9 Area and Volume of Similar Solids

Here you'll learn that the ratio of the surface areas of similar solids is equal to the square of their scale factor and

that the ratio of their volumes is equal to the cube of their scale factor.

What if you were given two similar square prisms and told what the scale factor of their sides was? How could you

find the ratio of their surface areas and the ratio of their volumes? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to

use the Surface Area Ratio and the Volume Ratio to solve problems like this.

Guidance

Two shapes are similar if all their corresponding angles are congruent and all their corresponding sides are propor-

tional. Two solids are similar if they are the same type of solid and their corresponding radii, heights, base lengths,

widths, etc. are proportional.

Surface Areas of Similar Solids

In two dimensions, when two shapes are similar, the ratio of their areas is the square of the scale factor. This

relationship holds in three dimensions as well. (

Surface Area Ratio: If two solids are similar with a scale factor of ab , then the surface areas are in a ratio of

a)2

b .

Volumes of Similar Solids

Just like surface area, volumes of similar solids have a relationship that is related to the scale factor(.

Volume Ratio: If two solids are similar with a scale factor of ab , then the volumes are in a ratio of

a)3

b .
