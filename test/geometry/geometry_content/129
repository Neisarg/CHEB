12.6 Composition of Transformations

Here you'll learn how to perform a composition of transformations. You'll also learn several theorems related to

composing transformations.

What if you were given the coordinates of a quadrilateral and you were asked to reflect the quadrilateral and then

translate it? What would its new coordinates be? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to perform a series

of transformations on a figure like this one in the coordinate plane.

Transformations Summary

A transformation is an operation that moves, flips, or otherwise changes a figure to create a new figure. A rigid

transformation (also known as an isometry or congruence transformation) is a transformation that does not

change the size or shape of a figure. The new figure created by a transformation is called the image. The original

figure is called the preimage.

There are three rigid transformations: translations, rotations and reflections. A translation is a transformation that

moves every point in a figure the same distance in the same direction. A rotation is a transformation where a figure

is turned around a fixed point to create an image. A reflection is a transformation that turns a figure into its mirror

image by flipping it over a line.

Composition of Transformations

A composition (of transformations) is when more than one transformation is performed on a figure. Compositions

can always be written as one rule. You can compose any transformations, but here are some of the most common

compositions:

1) A glide reflection is a composition of a reflection and a translation. The translation is in a direction parallel to the

line of reflection.

www.ck12.org Chapter 12. Rigid Transformations

2) The composition of two reflections over parallel lines that are h units apart is the same as a translation of 2h units

( Reflections over Parallel Lines Theorem).

3) If you compose two reflections over each axis, then the final image is a rotation of 180◦ around the origin of the

original ( Reflection over the Axes Theorem).

4) A composition of two reflections over lines that intersect at x◦ is the same as a rotation of 2x◦. The center of

rotation is the point of intersection of the two lines of reflection ( Reflection over Intersecting Lines Theorem).

Example A

Reflect4ABC over the y−axis and then translate the image 8 units down.

2) The composition of two reflections over parallel lines that are h units apart is the same as a translation of 2h units
( Reflections over Parallel Lines Theorem).
3) If you compose two reflections over each axis, then the final image is a rotation of 180◦ around the origin of the
original ( Reflection over the Axes Theorem).
4) A composition of two reflections over lines that intersect at x◦ is the same as a rotation of 2x◦. The center of
rotation is the point of intersection of the two lines of reflection ( Reflection over Intersecting Lines Theorem).
Example A
Reflect4ABC over the y−axis and then translate the image 8 units down.

The green image to the right is the final answer.
A(8,8)→ A′′(−8,0)
B(2,4)→ B′′(−2,−4)
C(10,2)→C′′(−10,−6)
Example B
Write a single rule for4ABC to4A′′B′′C′′ from Example A.
Looking at the coordinates of A to A′′, the x−value is the opposite sign and the y−value is y−8. Therefore the rule
would be (x,y)→ (−x,y−8).
Example C
Reflect4ABC over y = 3 and then reflect the image over y =−5.
706
www.ck12.org Chapter 12. Rigid Transformations
Order matters, so you would reflect over y = 3 first, (red triangle) then reflect it over y =−5 (green triangle).
Example D
A square is reflected over two lines that intersect at a 79◦ angle. What one transformation will this be the same as?
From the Reflection over Intersecting Lines Theorem, this is the same as a rotation of 2 ·79◦ = 178◦.

Guided Practice
1. Write a single rule for4ABC to4A′′B′′C′′ from Example C.
2. 4DEF has vertices D(3,−1),E(8,−3), and F(6,4). Reflect 4DEF over x = −5 and then x = 1. Determine
which one translation this double reflection would be the same as.
3. Reflect4DEF from Question 2 over the x−axis, followed by the y−axis. Find the coordinates of4D′′E ′′F ′′ and
the one transformation this double reflection is the same as.
4. Copy the figure below and reflect the triangle over l, followed by m.
Answers:
1. In the graph, the two lines are 8 units apart (3− (−5) = 8). The figures are 16 units apart. The double reflection
is the same as a translation that is double the distance between the parallel lines. (x,y)→ (x,y−16).
2. From the Reflections over Parallel Lines Theorem, we know that this double reflection is going to be the same as
a single translation of 2(1− (−5)) or 12 units.

3. 4D′′E ′′F ′′ is the green triangle in the graph to the left. If we compare the coordinates of it to4DEF , we have:
D(3,−1)→ D′′(−3,1)
E(8,−3)→ E ′′(−8,3)
F(6,4)→ F ′′(−6,−4)
4. The easiest way to reflect the triangle is to fold your paper on each line of reflection and draw the image. The
final result should look like this (the green triangle is the final answer):
