5.3 Angle Bisectors in Triangles

Here you'll learn what an angle bisector is as well as the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that if a point is on

the bisector of an angle, then the point is equidistant from the sides of the angle.

What if you were told that GJ is the angle bisector of 6 FGH? How would you find the length of FJ given the length

of HJ? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the Angle Bisector Theorem to solve problems like this

one.

Guidance

An angle bisector cuts an angle exactly in half. One important property of angle bisectors is that if a point is on

the bisector of an angle, then the point is equidistant from the sides of the angle. This is called the Angle Bisector

Theorem.

In other words, if BD bisects 6 ABC, BA⊥ FD, and, BC ⊥ DG then FD = DG.

The converse of this theorem is also true.

Angle Bisector Theorem Converse: If a point is in the interior of an angle and equidistant from the sides, then it

lies on the bisector of that angle.

When we construct angle bisectors for the angles of a triangle, they meet in one point. This point is called the

incenter of the triangle.

Example A
Is Y on the angle bisector of 6 XWZ?
If Y is on the angle bisector, then XY = Y Z and both segments need to be perpendicular to the sides of the angle.
From the markings we know XY ⊥−−→WX and ZY ⊥−→WZ. Second, XY =Y Z = 6. So, yes, Y is on the angle bisector of
6 XWZ.

CB = BD by the Angle Bisector Theorem, so we can set up and solve an equation for x.
x+7 = 2(3x−4)
x+7 = 6x−8
15 = 5x
x = 3

3. A 108◦ angle is bisected. What are the measures of the resulting angles?
Answers:
1.CB = BD by the Angle Bisector Theorem, so x = 6.
2. No because B is not necessarily equidistant from AC and AD. We do not know if the angles in the diagram are
right angles.
3. We know that to bisect means to cut in half, so each of the resulting angles will be half of 108. The measure of
each resulting angle is 54◦.
