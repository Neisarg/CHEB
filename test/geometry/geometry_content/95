9.7 Angles On and Inside a Circle

Here you'll learn how to use the Chord/Tangent Angle Theorem and the Intersecting Chords Angle Theorem to solve

problems containing angles that are on or inside a circle.

What if you were given a circle with either a chord and a tangent or two chords that meet at a common point? How

could you use the measure of the arc(s) formed by those circle parts to find the measure of the angles they make on

or inside the circle? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to apply the Chord/Tangent Angle Theorem and

the Intersecting Chords Angle Theorem to solve problems like this one.

Angles On and Inside a Circle CK-12

Guidance

When we say an angle is on a circle, we mean the vertex is on the edge of the circle. One type of angle on a circle is

the inscribed angle (see Inscribed Angles in Circles ). Another type of angle on a circle is one formed by a tangent

and a chord.

Chord/Tangent Angle Theorem: The measure of an angle formed by a chord and a tangent that intersect on a circle

is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

m6 DBA = 12 mÂB

If two angles, with their vertices on the circle, intercept the same arc then the angles are congruent.

An angle is inside a circle when the vertex lies anywhere inside the circle.

Intersecting Chords Angle Theorem: The measure of the angle formed by two chords that intersect inside a circle

is the average of the measures of the intercepted arcs.
