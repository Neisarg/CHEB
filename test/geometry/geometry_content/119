11.6 Cones

Here you'll learn what a cone is and how to find its volume and surface area.

What if you were given a three-dimensional solid figure with a circular base and sides that taper up towards a

vertex? How could you determine how much two-dimensional and three-dimensional space that figure occupies?

After completing this Concept, you'll be able to find the surface area and volume of a cone.

Guidance

A cone is a solid with a circular base and sides that taper up towards a vertex. A cone is generated from rotating a

right triangle, around one leg. A cone has a slant height.

Surface Area

Surface area is a two-dimensional measurement that is the total area of all surfaces that bound a solid. The basic

unit of area is the square unit. For the surface area of a cone we need the sum of the area of the base and the area of

the sides.

Surface Area of a Right Cone: SA = pir2 +pirl.

Area of the base: pir2

Area of the sides: pirl

Volume

To find the volume of any solid you must figure out how much space it occupies. The basic unit of volume is the

cubic unit.

Volume of a Cone: V = 13pir

2h.

Example A

What is the surface area of the cone?

First, we need to find the slant height. Use the Pythagorean Theorem.

l2 = 92 +212

= 8√1+441

l = 522≈ 22.85

The total surface area, then, is SA = pi92 +pi(9)(22.85)≈ 900.54 units2.

Example A
What is the surface area of the cone?
First, we need to find the slant height. Use the Pythagorean Theorem.
l2 = 92 +212
= 8√1+441
l = 522≈ 22.85
The total surface area, then, is SA = pi92 +pi(9)(22.85)≈ 900.54 units2.

Example B
Find the volume of the cone.
First, we need the height. Use the Pythagorean Theorem.
52 +h2 = 1√5

Guided Practice
1. The surface area of a cone is 36pi and the radius is 4 units. What is the slant height?
2. The volume of a cone is 484pi cm3 and the height is 12 cm. What is the radius?
3. Find the surface area and volume of the right cone. Round your answers to 2 decimal places.
Answers:
1. Plug what you know into the formula for the surface area of a cone and solve for l.
36pi= pi42 +pi4l
36 = 16+4l When each term has a pi, they cancel out.
20 = 4l
5 = l
2. Plug what you know to the volume formula.
1
484pi= pir2(12)
3
121 = r2
11 cm = r
3. First we need to find the radius. Use the Pythagorean Theorem.
r2 +402 = 412
r2 = 81
r = 9
Now use the formulas to find surface area and volume. Use the pi button on your calculator to help approximate your
answer at the end.
