10.10 Area of a Circle

Here you'll learn how to find the area of a circle given its radius or diameter.

What if you were given the radius or diameter of a circle? How could you find the amount of space the circle takes

up? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the formula for the area of a circle to solve problems like

this.

To find the area of a circle, all you need to know is its radius. If r is the radius of a circle, then its area is A = pir2.

We will leave our answers in terms of pi, unless otherwise specified. To see a derivation of this formula, see http://w

Example A

Find the area of a circle with a diameter of 12 c(m. )

If d = 12 cm, then r = 6 cm. The area is A = pi 62 = 36pi cm2.

Example B

If the area of a circle is 20pi units, what is the radius?

Plug in the area and solve for the radius.

20pi= pir2

20 = r2√ √

r = 20 = 2 5units

Example C

A circle is inscribed in a square. Each side of the square is 10 cm long. What is the area of the circle?

The diameter of the circle is the same as the length of a side of the square. Therefore, the radius is 5 cm.

A = pi52 = 25pi cm2

Guided Practice
1. Find the area of the shaded region from Example C.
2. Find the diameter of a circle with area 36pi.
3. Find the area of a circle with diameter 20 inches.
Answers:
1. The area of the shaded region would be the area of the square minus the area of the circle.
A = 102−25pi= 100−25pi≈ 21.46 cm2
2. First, use the formula for the area of a circle to solve for the radius of the circle.
A = pir2
36pi= pir2
36 = r2
r = 6
If the radius is 6 units, then the diameter is 12 units.
3. If the diameter is 20 inches that means that the radius is 10 inches. Now we can use the formula for the area of a
circle. A = pi(10)2 = 100pi in2 .
