1.7 Complementary Angles

Here you'll learn what complementary angles are and how to solve complementary angle problems.

What if you were given two angles of unknown size and were told they are complementary? How would you

determine their angle measures? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the definition of complementary

angles to solve problems like this one.

Guidance

Two angles are complementary if they add up to 90◦. Complementary angles do not have to be congruent or

adjacent.

Example A

The two angles below are complementary. m6 GHI = x. What is x?

Because the two angles are complementary, they add up to 90◦. Make an equation.

x+34◦ = 90◦

x = 56◦

Example B

The two angles below are complementary. Find the measure of each angle.

The two angles add up to 90◦. Make an equation.

(8r+9)+(7r+6) = 90◦

(15r+15) = 90◦

15r = 75◦

r = 5◦

However, you need to find each angle. Plug r back into each expression.

m 6 GHI = 8(5◦)+9◦ = 49◦

m6 JKL = 7(5◦)+6◦ = 41◦

Example C

Find the measure of an angle that is complementary to 6 MRS if m6 MRS is 70◦.

Because complementary angles have to add up to 90◦, the other angle must be 90◦−70◦ = 20◦.

Guided Practice
Find the measure of an angle that is complementary to 6 ABC if m6 ABC is:
1. 45◦
2. 82◦
3. 19◦
4. 12◦
Answers:
1. 90◦−45◦ = 45◦.
2. 90◦−82◦ = 8◦.
3. 90◦−19◦ = 71◦.
4. 90◦−12◦ = 78◦.
