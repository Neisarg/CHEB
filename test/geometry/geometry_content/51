5.6 Comparing Angles and Sides in Triangles

Here you'll learn how to order the angles of a triangle from largest to smallest based on the length of their opposite

sides. You'll also learn the SAS and SSS Inequality Theorems.

What if you were told that a triangle has sides that measure 3, 4, and 5? How could you determine which of the

triangle's angles is largest? Smallest? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use triangle theorems to solve

problems like this one.

James Sousa: Proof that the Angle of a Triangle Opposite The Longest Side is the Largest Angle

Guidance

Look at the triangle below. The sides of the triangle are given. Can you determine which angle is the largest? The

largest angle will be opposite 18 because that is the longest side. Similarly, the smallest angle will be opposite 7,

which is the shortest side.

This idea is actually a theorem: If one side of a triangle is longer than another side, then the angle opposite the longer

side will be larger than the angle opposite the shorter side.

The converse is also true: If one angle in a triangle is larger than another angle in that triangle, then the side opposite

the larger angle will be longer than the side opposite the smaller angle.

We can extend this idea into two theorems that help us compare sides and angles in two triangles If we have two

congruent triangles4ABC and4DEF , marked below:

Therefore, if AB = DE, BC = EF , and m 6 B = m 6 E, then AC = DF .

Now, let's make m 6 B > m6 E. Would that make AC > DF? Yes. This idea is called the SAS Inequality Theorem.

The SAS Inequality Theorem: If two sides of a triangle are congruent to two sides of another triangle, but the

included angle of one triangle has greater measure than the included angle of the other triangle, then the third side

of the first triangle is longer than the third side of the second triangle.

If AB∼= DE,BC ∼= EF and m6 B > m6 E, then AC > DF .

If we know the third sides as opposed to the angles, the opposite idea is also true and is called the SSS Inequality

Theorem.

SSS Inequality Theorem: If two sides of a triangle are congruent to two sides of another triangle, but the third side

of the first triangle is longer than the third side of the second triangle, then the included angle of the first triangle's

two congruent sides is greater in measure than the included angle of the second triangle's two congruent sides.

If AB∼= DE, BC ∼= EF and AC > DF , then m 6 B > m6 E.

the larger angle will be longer than the side opposite the smaller angle.

Example A
List the sides in order, from shortest to longest.
First, find m6 A. From the Triangle Sum Theorem:
m 6 A+86◦+27◦ = 180◦
m6 A = 67◦
86◦ is the largest angle, so AC is the longest side. The next angle is 67◦, so BC would be the next longest side. 27◦
is the smallest angle, so AB is the shortest side. In order, the answer is: AB, BC, AC.
Example B
List the angles in order, from largest to smallest.
Just like with the sides, the largest angle is opposite the longest side. The longest side is BC, so the largest angle is
6 A. Next would be 6 B and then 6 C.
Example C
List the sides in order, from least to greatest.
To solve, let's start with 4DCE. The missing angle is 55◦. By the theorem presented in this Concept, the sides, in
order from least to greatest are CE, CD, and DE.

www.ck12.org Chapter 5. Triangle Relationships
For 4BCD, the missing angle is 43◦. Again, by the theorem presented in this Concept, the order of the sides from
least to greatest is BD, CD, and BC.
By the SAS Inequality Theorem, we know that BC >DE, so the order of all the sides would be: BD, CE, CD, DE, BC.

1. If XM is a median of4XY Z and XY > XZ, what can we say about m6 1 and m6 2?
2. List the sides of the two triangles in order, from shortest to longest.
3. Below is isosceles triangle4ABC. List everything you can about the sides and angles of the triangle and why.
Answers:
1. M is the midpoint of Y Z, so Y M = MZ. MX = MX by the Reflexive Property and we know XY > XZ.

5.6. Comparing Angles and Sides in Triangles www.ck12.org
We can use the SSS Inequality Theorem Converse to say m6 1 > m6 2.
2. There are no congruent sides or angles. Look at each triangle separately.
4XY Z: The missing angle is 42◦. By the theorem presented in this lesson, the order of the sides from shortest to
longest is Y Z, XY , and XZ.
4WXZ: The missing angle is 55◦. The order of the sides from shortest to longest is XZ, WZ, and WX .
Because the longest side in 4XY Z is the shortest side in 4WXZ, we can put all the sides together in one list:
Y Z, XY, XZ, WZ, WX .
3. AB = BC because it is given.
m6 A = m 6 C because if sides are equal than their opposite angles must be equal..
AD < DC because m6 ABD < m6 CBD and because of the SAS Triangle Inequality Theorem.
