11.4 Cylinders

Here you'll learn what a cylinder is and how to find its volume and surface area.

What if you were given a solid three-dimensional figure with congruent enclosed circular bases that are in parallel

planes? How could you determine how much two-dimensional and three-dimensional space that figure occupies?

After completing this Concept, you'll be able to find the surface area and volume of a cylinder.

Guidance

A cylinder is a solid with congruent circular bases that are in parallel planes. The space between the circles is

enclosed.

A cylinder has a radius and a height.

A cylinder can also be oblique (slanted) like the one below.

Surface Area

Surface area is the sum of the area of the faces of a solid. The basic unit of area is the square unit.

Surface Area of a Right Cylinder: SA = 2pir2 +2pirh.

Volume

To find the volume of any solid you must figure out how much space it occupies. The basic unit of volume is the

cubic unit. For cylinders, volume is the area of the circular base times the height.

Volume of a Cylinder: V = pir2h.

If an oblique cylinder has the same base area and height as another cylinder, then it will have the same volume. This

is due to Cavalieri's Principle, which states that if two solids have the same height and the same cross-sectional

area at every level, then they will have the same volume.

r = 4 and h = 12.
SA = 2pi(4)2 +2pi(4)(12)
= 32pi+96pi
= 128pi units2
Example B
The circumference of the base of a cylinder is 16pi and the height is 21. Find the surface area of the cylinder.
We need to solve for the radius, using the circumference.
2pir = 16pi
r = 8
Now, we can find the surface area.
SA = 2pi(8)2 +(16pi)(21)
= 128pi+336pi
= 464pi units2
Example C
Find the volume of the cylinder.
If the diameter is 16, then the radius is 8.
V = pi82(21) = 1344pi units3

Guided Practice
1. Find the volume of the cylinder.
2. If the volume of a cylinder is 484pi in3 and the height is 4 in, what is the radius?
3. The circumference of the base of a cylinder is 80pi cm and the height is 36 cm. Find the total surface area.
Answers:
1. V = pi62(15) = 540pi units3
2. Solve for r.
484pi= pir2(4)
121 = r2
11in = r
3. We need to solve for the radius, using the circumference.
2pir = 80pi
r = 40
Now, we can find the surface area.
SA = 2pi(40)2 +(80pi)(36)
= 3200pi+2880pi
= 6080pi units2
