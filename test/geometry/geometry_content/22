3.1 Parallel and Skew Lines

Here you'll learn the difference between parallel and skew lines. You'll also learn basic properties of parallel lines

and the definition of a transversal.

What if you were given a pair of lines that never intersect and were asked to describe them? What terminology

would you use? After completing this Concept, you will be able to define the terms parallel line, skew line, and

transversal. You'll also be able to apply the properties associated with parallel lines.

James Sousa: Parallel Line Postulate

Guidance

Parallel lines are two or more lines that lie in the same plane and never intersect. To show that lines are parallel,

arrows are used.

TABLE 3.1:

L←→abe

AB||←

l→It Say It

MN Line AB is parallel to line MN

l||m Line l is parallel to line m.

In the definition of parallel the word "line" is used. However, line segments, rays and planes can also be parallel.

The image below shows two parallel planes, with a third blue plane that is perpendicular to both of them.

Skew lines are lines that are in different planes and never intersect. They are different from parallel lines because

parallel lines lie in the SAME plane. In the cube below, AB and FH are skew and AC and EF are skew.

Basic Facts About Parallel Lines

Property: If lines l||m and m||n, then l||n.

then
Postulate: For any line and a point not on the line, there is one line parallel to this line through the point. There are
infinitely many lines that go through A, but only one that is parallel to l.
A transversal is a line that intersects two other lines. The area between l and m is the interior. The area outside l
and m is the exterior.
Example A
True or false: some pairs of skew lines are also parallel.
This is false, by definition skew lines are in different planes and parallel lines are in the same plane. Two lines
could be skew or parallel (or neither), but never both.
