7.11 Dilation

Here you'll learn what a dilation is, how to dilate a figure, and how to find the scale factor by which the figure is

dilated.

What if you enlarged or reduced a triangle without changing its shape? How could you find the scale factor by which

the triangle was stretched or shrunk? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the corresponding sides

of dilated figures to solve problems like this one.

Guidance

Two figures are similar if they are the same shape but not necessarily the same size. One way to create similar

figures is by dilating. A dilation makes a figure larger or smaller but the new resulting figure has the same shape as

the original.

Dilation: An enlargement or reduction of a figure that preserves shape but not size. All dilations are similar to the

original figure.

Dilations have a center and a scale factor. The center is the point of reference for the dilation and the scale factor

tells us how much the figure stretches or shrinks. A scale factor is labeled k. Only positive scale factors, k, will be

considered in this text.

If the dilated image is smaller than the original, then 0 < k < 1.

If the dilated image is larger than the original, then k > 1.

A dilation, or image, is always followed by a ′.

Label It Say It

′ "prime" (copy of the original)

A′ "a prime" (copy of point A)

A′′ "a double prime" (second copy)

Example A

The center of dilation is P and the scale factor is 3.

Find Q′.

If the scale factor is 3 and Q is 6 units away from P, then Q′ is going to be 6×3 = 18 units away from P. The dilated

image will be on the same line as the original image and center.

Example B

Using the picture above, change the scale factor to 13 .

Find Q′′ using this new scale factor.

The scale factor is 13 , so Q

′′ is going to be 6× 13 = 2 units away from P. Q′′ will also be collinear with Q and center.

Example C

KLMN is a rectangle. If the center of dilation is K and k = 2, draw K′L′M′N′.

Example A
The center of dilation is P and the scale factor is 3.
Find Q′.
If the scale factor is 3 and Q is 6 units away from P, then Q′ is going to be 6×3 = 18 units away from P. The dilated
image will be on the same line as the original image and center.
Example B
Using the picture above, change the scale factor to 13 .
Find Q′′ using this new scale factor.
The scale factor is 13 , so Q
′′ is going to be 6× 13 = 2 units away from P. Q′′ will also be collinear with Q and center.
Example C
KLMN is a rectangle. If the center of dilation is K and k = 2, draw K′L′M′N′.

If K is the center of dilation, then K and K′ will be the same point. From there, L′ will be 8 units above L and N′ will
be 12 units to the right of N.

Guided Practice
1. Find the perimeters of KLMN and K′L′M′N′. Compare this ratio to the scale factor.

7.11. Dilation www.ck12.org
2. 4ABC is a dilation of4DEF . If P is the center of dilation, what is the scale factor?
3. Find the scale factor, given the corresponding sides. In the diagram, the black figure is the original and P is the
center of dilation.
Answers:
1. The perimeter of KLMN = 12+8+12+8 = 40. The perimeter of K′L′M′N′ = 24+16+24+16 = 80. The ratio
is 80:40, which reduces to 2:1, which is the same as the scale factor.
2. Because 4ABC is a dilation of 4DEF , then 4ABC ∼4DEF . The scale factor is the ratio of the sides. Since
4ABC is smaller than the original,4DEF , the scale factor is going to be less than one, 1220 = 35 .
If4DEF was the dilated image, the scale factor would have been 53 .
3. Since the dilation is smaller than the original, the scale factor is going to be less than one. 820 =
2
