3.3 Corresponding Angles

Here you'll learn what corresponding angles are and what relationship they have with parallel lines.

What if you were presented with two angles that are in the same place with respect to the transversal but on different

lines? How would you describe these angles and what could you conclude about their measures? After completing

this Concept, you'll be able to answer these questions and use corresponding angle postulates.

James Sousa: Corresponding Angles Converse

Guidance

Corresponding angles are two angles that are in the "same place" with respect to the transversal but on different

lines. Imagine sliding the four angles formed with line l down to line m. The angles which match up are correspond-

ing.

Corresponding Angles Postulate: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the corresponding angles are

congruent.

If l||m, then 6 1∼= 6 2.

Converse of Corresponding Angles Postulate: If corresponding angles are congruent when two lines are cut by a

transversal, then the lines are parallel.

then l||m.
Example A
If a||b, which pairs of angles are congruent by the Corresponding Angles Postulate?
There are 4 pairs of congruent corresponding angles:
6 1∼= 6 5, 6 2∼= 6 6, 6 3∼= 6 7, and 6 4∼= 6 8.
Example B
If m6 2 = 76◦, what is m6 6?
6 2 and 6 6 are corresponding angles and l||m from the arrows in the figure. 6 2 ∼= 6 6 by the Corresponding Angles
Postulate, which means that m 6 6 = 76◦.
Example C
If m6 8 = 110◦ and m6 4 = 110◦, then what do we know about lines l and m?
118
www.ck12.org Chapter 3. Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
6 8 and 6 4 are corresponding angles. Since m 6 8 = m6 4, we can conclude that l||m.

3.3. Corresponding Angles www.ck12.org
1. If m6 2 = 76◦, then m6 1 = 180◦−76◦ = 104◦ (linear pair). 6 3∼= 6 2 (vertical angles), so m6 3 = 76◦. m6 4 = 104◦
(vertical angle with 6 1).
By the Corresponding Angles Postulate, we know 6 1∼= 6 5, 6 2∼= 6 6, 6 3∼= 6 7, and 6 4∼= 6 8, so m6 5 = 104◦, m6 6 =
76◦, m 6 7 = 76◦, and m 6 104◦.
2. The two angles are corresponding and must be equal to say that l||m. 116◦ 6= 118◦, so l is not parallel to m.
3. The horizontal lines are marked parallel and the angle marked 2y is corresponding to the angle marked 80 so these
two angles are congruent. This means that 2y = 80 and therefore y = 40.
