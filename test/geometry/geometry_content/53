5.8 Indirect Proof in Algebra and Geometry

Here you'll learn how to write indirect proofs, or proofs by contradiction, by assuming a hypothesis is false.

What if you wanted to prove a statement was true without a two-column proof? How might you go about doing so?

After completing this Concept, you'll be able to indirectly prove a statement by way of contradiction.

James Sousa: Introduction to Indirect Proof

Guidance

Most likely, the first type of formal proof you learned was a direct proof using direct reasoning. Most of the proofs

done in geometry are done in the two-column format, which is a direct proof format. Another common type of

reasoning is indirect reasoning, which you have likely done outside of math class. Below we will formally learn

what an indirect proof is and see some examples in both algebra and geometry.

Indirect Proof or Proof by Contradiction: When the conclusion from a hypothesis is assumed false (or opposite

of what it states) and then a contradiction is reached from the given or deduced statements.

In other words, if you are trying to show that something is true, show that if it was not true there would be a

contradiction (something else would not make sense).

The steps to follow when proving indirectly are:

• Assume the opposite of the conclusion (second half) of the statement.

• Proceed as if this assumption is true to find the contradiction.

• Once there is a contradiction, the original statement is true.

• DO NOT use specific examples. Use variables so that the contradiction can be generalized.

The easiest way to understand indirect proofs is by example.

Example A (Algebra Example)

If x = 2, then 3x−5 6= 10. Prove this statement is true by contradiction.

Remember that in an indirect proof the first thing you do is assume the conclusion of the statement is false. In this

case, we will assume the opposite of "If x = 2, then 3x−5 6= 10":

If x = 2, then 3x−5 = 10.

Take this statement as true and solve for x.

3x−5 = 10

3x = 15

x = 5

But x = 5 contradicts the given statement that x = 2. Hence, our assumption is incorrect and 3x−5 6= 10 is true.

Example B (Geometry Example)

If4ABC is isosceles, then the measure of the base angles cannot be 92◦. Prove this indirectly.

Remember, to start assume the opposite of the conclusion.

The measure of the base angles are 92◦.

If the base angles are 92◦, then they add up to 184◦. This contradicts the Triangle Sum Theorem that says the three

angle measures of all triangles add up to 180◦. Therefore, the base angles cannot be 92◦.

Example C (Geometry Example)

If 6 A and 6 B are complementary then 6 A≤ 90◦. Prove this by contradiction.

Assume the opposite of the conclusion.

6 A > 90◦.

Consider first that the measure of 6 B cannot be negative. So if 6 A > 90◦ this contradicts the definition of comple-

mentary, which says that two angles are complementary if they add up to 90◦. Therefore, 6 A≤ 90◦.

Example A (Algebra Example)
If x = 2, then 3x−5 6= 10. Prove this statement is true by contradiction.
Remember that in an indirect proof the first thing you do is assume the conclusion of the statement is false. In this
case, we will assume the opposite of "If x = 2, then 3x−5 6= 10":
If x = 2, then 3x−5 = 10.
Take this statement as true and solve for x.
3x−5 = 10
3x = 15
x = 5
But x = 5 contradicts the given statement that x = 2. Hence, our assumption is incorrect and 3x−5 6= 10 is true.

2. Prove the SSS Inequality Theorem is true by contradiction. (The SSS Inequality Theorem says: "If two sides of
a triangle are congruent to two sides of another triangle, but the third side of the first triangle is longer than the third
side of the second triangle, then the included angle of the first triangle's two congruent sides is greater in measure
than the included angle of the second triangle's two congruent sides.")
3. If x = 3, then 4x+1 6= 17. Prove this statement is true by contradiction.
Answers:
1. First, assume the opposite of "n is odd."
n is even.
Now, square n and see what happens.
If n is even, then n = 2a, where a is any integer.
n2 = (2a)2 = 4a2
This means that n2 is a multiple of 4. No odd number can be divided evenly by an even number, so this contradicts
our assumption that n is even. Therefore, n must be odd if n2 is odd.
2. First, assume the opposite of the conclusion.
The included angle of the first triangle is less than or equal to the included angle of the second triangle.
If the included angles are equal then the two triangles would be congruent by SAS and the third sides would be
congruent by CPCTC. This contradicts the hypothesis of the original statement "the third side of the first triangle is
longer than the third side of the second." Therefore, the included angle of the first triangle must be larger than the
included angle of the second.
3. In an indirect proof the first thing you do is assume the conclusion of the statement is false. In this case, we will
assume the opposite of "If x = 3, then 4x+1 6= 17":
If x = 3, then 4x+1 = 17
Take this statement as true and solve for x.
4x+1 = 17
4x = 16
x = 4
x = 4 contradicts the given statement that x = 3. Hence, our assumption is incorrect and 4x+1 6= 17 is true.

presented. The properties of medians and altitudes of triangles are discussed in detail. The entire chapter builds to
a discovery of the relationships between the angles and sides in triangles as a foundation for the Triangle Inequality
Theorem. The chapter ends with a presentation of indirect proofs.
