5.4 Medians

Here you'll learn the definitions of median and centroid as well as the Median Theorem, which states that the

medians of a triangle intersect at a point that is two-thirds of the distance from the vertices to the midpoint of the

opposite sides.

What if you were told that J, K, and L were the midpoints of the sides of 4FGH and that M was the centroid of

4FGH? Given the length of JK, how could you find the lengths of JM and KM? After completing this Concept,

you'll be able to use the Median Theorem to solve problems like this one.

Guidance

In a triangle, the line segment that joins a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side is called a median.

www.ck12.org Chapter 5. Triangle Relationships

LO is the median from L to the midpoint of NM.

If you draw all three medians they will intersect at one point called the centroid.

The centroid is the "balancing point" of a triangle. This means that if you were to cut out the triangle, the centroid

is its center of gravity so you could balance it there.

The Median Theorem states that the medians of a triangle intersect at a point called the centroid that is two-thirds

of the distance from the vertices to the midpoint of the opposite sides.

So if G is the centroid, then:

AG = AD, CG = CF, EG = BE

DG = AD, FG = CF, BG = BE

And by substitution : DG = AG, FG = CG, BG = EG

I, K, and M are midpoints of the sides of4HJL.

a) If JM = 18, find JN and NM.
b) If HN = 14, find NK and HK.
To solve, use the Median Theorem.
a) JN = 23 ·18 = 12. NM = JM− JN = 18−12. NM = 6.
b) 14 = 23 ·HK
14 · 32 = HK = 21. NK is a third of 21, NK = 7.
Example B
H is the centroid of4ABC and DC = 5y−16. Find x and y.
To solve, use the Median Theorem. Set up and solve equations.

CF = 24
.
Therefore, GF = 8
2. This statement is true. By definition, a median intersects a side of a triangle at its midpoint. Midpoints divide
segments into two equal parts.
3. Use the Median Theorem.
a. C is the centroid.
b. XN = 12 XY , so XY = 10.
