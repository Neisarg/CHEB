12.5 Reflections

Here you'll learn what a reflection is and how to find the coordinates of a reflected figure.

What if you were given the coordinates of a quadrilateral and you were asked to reflect that quadrilateral over the

y−axis? What would its new coordinates be? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to reflect a figure like

this one in the coordinate plane.

Transformation: Reflection CK-12

Guidance

A transformation is an operation that moves, flips, or otherwise changes a figure to create a new figure. A rigid

transformation (also known as an isometry or congruence transformation) is a transformation that does not

change the size or shape of a figure.

The rigid transformations are translations (discussed elsewhere), reflections (discussed here), and rotations (dis-

cussed elsewhere). The new figure created by a transformation is called the image. The original figure is called the

preimage. If the preimage is A, then the image would be A′, said "a prime." If there is an image of A′, that would be

labeled A′′, said "a double prime."

A reflection is a transformation that turns a figure into its mirror image by flipping it over a line. The line of

reflection is the line that a figure is reflected over. If a point is on the line of reflection then the image is the same as

the preimage. Images are always congruent to preimages.

While you can reflect over any line, some common lines of reflection have rules that are worth memorizing:

Reflection over the y−axis: (x,y)→ (−x,y)

Reflection over the x−axis: (x,y)→ (x,−y)

Reflection over y = x: (x,y)→ (y,x)

Reflection over y =−x: (x,y)→ (−y,−x)

Example A

Reflect4ABC over the y−axis. Find the coordinates of the image.

4A′B′C′ will be the same distance away from the y−axis as4ABC, but on the other side. Hence, their x-coordinates
will be opposite.
A(4,3)→ A′(−4,3)
B(7,−1)→ B′(−7,−1)
C(2,−2)→C′(−2,−2)
Example B
Reflect the letter "F ′′ over the x−axis.

12.5. Reflections www.ck12.org
When reflecting the letter F over the x−axis, the y−coordinates will be the same distance away from the x−axis, but
on the other side of the x−axis. Hence, their y-coordinates will be opposite.
Example C
Reflect the triangle 4ABC with vertices A(4,5),B(7,1) and C(9,6) over the line x = 5. Find the coordinates of A′,
B′, and C′.
The image's vertices are the same distance away from x = 5 as those of the preimage.

Guided Practice
1. Reflect the line segment PQ with endpoints P(−1,5) and Q(7,8) over the line y = 5.
2. A triangle4LMN and its reflection,4L′M′N′ are below. What is the line of reflection?
3. Reflect square ABCD over the line y = x.

4. Reflect the trapezoid T RAP over the line y =−x.
Answers:
1. P is on the line of reflection, which means P′ has the same coordinates. Q′ is the same distance away from y = 5,
but on the other side.
P(−1,5)→ P′(−1,5)
Q(7,8)→ Q′(7,2)

2. Looking at the graph, we see that the corresponding parts of the preimage and image intersect when y = 1.
Therefore, this is the line of reflection.
If the image does not intersect the preimage, find the midpoint between the preimage point and its image. This point
is on the line of reflection.
3. The purple line is y = x. Fold the graph on the line of reflection.
A(−1,5)→ A′(5,−1)
B(0,2)→ B′(2,0)
C(−3,1)→C′(1,−3)
D(−4,4)→ D′(4,−4)
4. The purple line is y =−x. You can reflect the trapezoid over this line.
T (2,2)→ T ′(−2,−2)
R(4,3)→ R′(−3,−4)
A(5,1)→ A′(−1,−5)
P(1,−1)→ P′(1,−1)
