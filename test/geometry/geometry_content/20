2.7 Two-Column Proofs

Here you'll learn how to create two-column proofs with statements and reasons for each step you take in proving a

geometric statement.

−

Suppose you are told that 6

→

XY Z is a right angle and that YW bisects 6 XY Z. You are then asked to prove 6 XYW ∼=

6 WY Z. After completing this Concept, you'll be able to create a two-column proof to prove this congruency.

CK-12 Two Column Proofs

Guidance

A two column proof is one common way to organize a proof in geometry. Two column proofs always have two

columns- statements and reasons. The best way to understand two column proofs is to read through examples.

When writing your own two column proof, these keep things in mind:

• Number each step.

• Start with the given information.

• Statements with the same reason can be combined into one step. It is up to you.

• Draw a picture and mark it with the given information.

• You must have a reason for EVERY statement.

• The order of the statements in the proof is not always fixed, but make sure the order makes logical

sense.

• Reasons will be definitions, postulates, properties and previously proven theorems. "Given" is only used

as a reason if the information in the statement column was told in the problem.

• Use symbols and abbreviations for words within proofs. For example, ∼= can be used in place of the word

congruent. You could also use 6 for the word angle.

Example A

Write a two-column proof for the following:

If A,B,C, and D are points on a line, in the given order, and AB =CD, then AC = BD.

When the statement is given in this way, the "if" part is the given and the "then" part is what we are trying to prove.

Always start with drawing a picture of what you are given.

Plot the points in the order A,B,C,D on a line.

Given: BF bisects 6 ABC; 6 ABD∼= 6 CBE

Prove: 6 DBF ∼= 6 EBF

First, put the appropriate markings on the picture. Recall, that bisect means "to cut in half." Therefore, m6 ABF =

m6 FBC.

theorem.
