10.7 Area and Perimeter of Similar Polygons

Here you'll learn that the ratio of the perimeters of similar figures is equal to their scale factor and that the ratio of

their areas is equal to the square of their scale factor.

What if you were given two similar triangles and told what the scale factor of their sides was? How could you find

the ratio of their perimeters and the ratio of their areas? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the

Area of Similar Polygons Theorem to solve problems like this.

Guidance

Polygons are similar when their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding sides are in the same

proportion. Just as their corresponding sides are in the same proportion, perimeters and areas of similar polygons

have a special relationship.

Perimeters: The ratio of the perimeters is the same as the scale factor. In fact, the ratio of any part of two similar

shapes (diagonals, medians, midsegments, altitudes, etc.) is the same as the scale factor. (m)Areas: If the scale factor of the sides of two similar polygons is mn , then the ratio of the areas is 2n ( Area of

Similar Polygons Theorem). You square the ratio because area is a two-dimensional measurement.

Example A

The two rectangles below are similar. Find the scale factor and the ratio of the perimeters and verify that the two

results are the same.

The scale factor is 1624 =

3 .

Psmall = 2(10)+2(16) = 52 units

Plarge = 2(15)+2(24) = 78 units

The ratio of the perimeters is 5278 =

3 .

Example B

Find the area of each rectangle from Example A. Then, find the ratio of the areas and verify that it fits the Area of

Similar Polygons Theorem.

Asmall = 10 ·16 = 160 units2

Alarge = 15 ·24 = 360 units2

The ratio of the areas would be 160360 =

The ratio of the sides, or scale factor is 23 and the ratio of the areas is

4

9 . Notice that the ratio of the areas is the square

of the scale factor.

Example C

Find the ratio of the areas of the rhombi below. The rhombi are similar.
