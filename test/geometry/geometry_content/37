4.4 Congruence Statements

Here you'll learn how to write congruence statements that show which sides and angles of congruent triangles are

congruent.

What if you were told that 4FGH ∼=4XY Z? How could you determine which side in 4XY Z is congruent to GH

and which angle is congruent to 6 F? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to state which sides and angles

are congruent in congruent triangles.

James Sousa: Introduction to Congruent Triangles

Guidance

When stating that two triangles are congruent, the corresponding parts must be written in the same order. For

example, if we know that4ABC and4LMN are congruent then we know that:

Notice that the congruent sides also line up within the congruence statement.

AB∼= LM, BC ∼= MN, AC ∼= LN

We can also write this congruence statement five other ways, as long as the congruent angles match up. For example,

we can also write4ABC ∼=4LMN as:

4ACB∼=4LNM 4BCA∼=4MNL 4BAC ∼=4MLN

4CBA∼=4NML 4CAB∼=4NLM

Example A

Write a congruence statement for the two triangles below.

Line up the corresponding angles in the triangles:

6 R∼= 6 F, 6 S∼= 6 E, and 6 T ∼= 6 D.

Therefore, one possible congruence statement is4RST ∼= 6 FED

Example B

If4CAT ∼=4DOG, what else do you know?

From this congruence statement, we know three pairs of angles and three pairs of sides are congruent.

Example C

If4BUG∼=4ANT , what angle is congruent to 6 N?

Since the order of the letters in the congruence statement tells us which angles are congruent, 6 N ∼= 6 U because they

are each the second of the three letters.

Example A
Write a congruence statement for the two triangles below.
Line up the corresponding angles in the triangles:
6 R∼= 6 F, 6 S∼= 6 E, and 6 T ∼= 6 D.
Therefore, one possible congruence statement is4RST ∼= 6 FED
Example B
If4CAT ∼=4DOG, what else do you know?
From this congruence statement, we know three pairs of angles and three pairs of sides are congruent.
Example C
If4BUG∼=4ANT , what angle is congruent to 6 N?
