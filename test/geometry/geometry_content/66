7.3 Similar Polygons and Scale Factors

Here you'll learn what properties two or more polygons must possess to be similar. You'll also learn what a scale

factor is and how to solve for missing information in similar polygon problems.

What if you were told that two pentagons were similar and you were given the lengths of each pentagon's sides.

How could you determine the scale factor of pentagon #1 to pentagon #2? After completing this Concept, you'll be

able to answer questions like this one about similar polygons.

James Sousa: Scale Factor

Guidance

Similar polygons are two polygons with the same shape, but not the same size. Similar polygons have corresponding

angles that are congruent, and corresponding sides that are proportional.

These polygons are not similar:

Think about similar polygons as enlarging or shrinking the same shape. The symbol∼ is used to represent similarity.

Specific types of triangles, quadrilaterals, and polygons will always be similar. For example, all equilateral triangles

are similar and all squares are similar. If two polygons are similar, we know the lengths of corresponding sides are

proportional. In similar polygons, the ratio of one side of a polygon to the corresponding side of the other is called

the scale factor. The ratio of all parts of a polygon (including the perimeters, diagonals, medians, midsegments,

altitudes) is the same as the ratio of the sides.

Example A

Suppose 4ABC ∼ 4JKL. Based on the similarity statement, which angles are congruent and which sides are

proportional?

Just like in a congruence statement, the congruent angles line up within the similarity statement. So, 6 A∼= 6 J, 6 B∼=

6 K, and 6 C ∼= 6 L. Write the sides in a proportion: ABJK = BCKL = ACJL . Note that the proportion could be written in

different ways. For example, ABBC =

JK

KL is also true.

Example B

MNPQ∼ RSTU . What are the values of x,y and z?

In the similarity statement, 6 M ∼= 6 R, so z = 115◦. For x and y, set up proportions.

18 x 18 15

30 25 30 y

450 = 30x 18y = 450

x = 15 y = 25

Example C
ABCD∼ AMNP. Find the scale factor and the length of BC.
Line up the corresponding sides, AB and AM = CD, so the scale factor is 3045 =
2
3 or
3
2 . Because BC is in the bigger
rectangle, we will multiply 40 by 32 because
3
2 is greater than 1. BC =

1. ABCD and UVWX are below. Are these two rectangles similar?
2. What is the scale factor of4ABC to4XY Z? Write the similarity statement.
3. 4ABC ∼4MNP. The perimeter of4ABC is 150, AB = 32 and MN = 48. Find the perimeter of4MNP.
Answers:
1. All the corresponding angles are congruent because the shapes are rectangles.

Let's see if the sides are proportional. 812 =

3 and
18
24 =

4 .
2
3 6= 34 , so the sides are not in the same proportion, and the
rectangles are not similar.
2. All the sides are in the same ratio. Pick the two largest (or smallest) sides to find the ratio.

20 4
For the similarity statement, line up the proportional sides. AB→ XY,BC→ XZ,AC→ Y Z, so4ABC ∼4Y XZ.
3. From the similarity statement, AB and MN are corresponding sides. The scale factor is 3248 =
2
3 or
3
2 . 4ABC is the
smaller triangle, so the perimeter of4MNP is 32(150) = 225.
