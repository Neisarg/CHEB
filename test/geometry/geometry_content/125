12.2 Rotation Symmetry

Here you'll learn what rotational symmetry is and how to find the angle of rotation for a figure.

What if you had a six-pointed star and you rotated that star less than 360◦? If the rotated star looked exactly the same

as the original star, what would that say about the star? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to determine

if a figure like this one has rotational symmetry.

Rotation Symmetry CK-12

Guidance

Rotational symmetry is present when a figure can be rotated (less than 360◦) such that it looks like it did before the

rotation. The center of rotation is the point a figure is rotated around such that the rotational symmetry holds.

For the H, we can rotate it twice, the triangle can be rotated 3 times and still look the same and the hexagon can be

rotated 6 times.

Example A

Determine if the figure below has rotational symmetry. Find the angle and how many times it can be rotated.

The pentagon can be rotated 5 times. Because there are 5 lines of rotational symmetry, the angle would be 360

◦

5 = 72

◦.

Example B

Determine if the figure below has rotational symmetry. Find the angle and how many times it can be rotated.

The N can be rotated twice. This means the angle of rotation is 180◦.

Example C

Determine if the figure below has rotational symmetry. Find the angle and how many times it can be rotated.

The checkerboard can be rotated 4 times. There are 4 lines of rotational symmetry, so the angle of rotation is

360◦

4 = 90
