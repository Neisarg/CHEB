8.3 Applications of the Pythagorean Theorem

Here you'll learn how to use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the altitude of an isosceles triangle and to determine

if a triangle is acute, obtuse, or right.

What if you were given an equilateral triangle in which all the sides measured 4 inches? How could you use the

Pythagorean Theorem to find the triangle's altitude? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to solve problems

like this one.

Find the Height of an Isosceles Triangle

One way to use The Pythagorean Theorem is to find the height of an isosceles triangle (see Example A).

Prove the Distance Formula

Another application of the Pythagorean Theorem is the Distance Formula. We will prove it here.

Let's start with point A(x1,y1) and point B(x2,y2). We will call the distance between A and B,d.

Draw the vertical and horizontal lengths to make a right triangle.

Now that we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse, d.

d2 = (√x1− x2)2 +(y1− y2)2

d = (x1− x2)2 +(y1− y2)2√

Distance Formula: The distance between A(x1,y1) and B(x2,y2) is d = (x1− x2)2 +(y1− y2)2.

Classify a Triangle as Acute, Right, or Obtuse

We can extend the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem to determine if a triangle is an obtuse or acute triangle.

Acute Triangles: If the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides in a right triangle is greater than the square of

the longest side, then the triangle is acute.

Acute Triangles: If the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides in a right triangle is greater than the square of
the longest side, then the triangle is acute.

For b < c and a < c, if a2 +b2 > c2, then the triangle is acute.
Obtuse Triangles: If the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides in a right triangle is less than the square of the
longest side, then the triangle is obtuse.
For b < c and a < c, if a2 +b2 < c2, then the triangle is obtuse.
Example A
What is the height of the isosceles triangle?
Draw the altitude from the vertex between the congruent sides, which will bisect the base.
72 +h2 = 92
49+h2 = 81
h2 = 3√2 √ √
h = 32 = 16 ·2 = 4 2
Example B
Find the distance between (1, 5) and (5, 2).
Make A(1,5) and B(5,2). Plug into the distance formula.
√
d = √(1−5)2 +(5−2)2
= (−4)2 +(3)2
√ √
= 16+9 = 25 = 5

Just like the lengths of the sides of a triangle, distances are always positive.
Example C
Graph A(−4,1),B(3,8), and C(9,6). Determine if4ABC is acute, obtuse, or right.
Use the distance formula to find the length of each side.
√
AB √ √= (−4− √3)2 +(1−8)2 = 49+49 = 98√
BC = √(3−9)2 +(8− √6)2 = 36+4 = 40√
AC = (−4− √9)2 +(1−6)2 = 169+25 = 194
Plug these lengths into the Pythagorean Theorem.
(√ )2 (√ )2 (√ )2
98 + 40 ? 194
98+40 ? 194
138 < 194
4ABC is an obtuse triangle.

Answers:
Set the longest side equal to c.
1. ( √ )2
62 + 3 5 ? 82
36+45 ? 64
81 > 64
The triangle is acute.
2.
152 +142 ? 212
