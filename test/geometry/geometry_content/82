8.5 45-45-90 Right Triangles

√

Here you'll learn that the sides of a 45-45-90 right triangle are in the ratio x : x : x 2.

What if you were given an isosceles right triangle and the length of one of its sides? How could you figure out

the lengths of its other sides? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the 45-45-90 Theorem to solve

problems like this one.

Guidance

A right triangle with congruent legs and acute angles is an Isosceles Right Triangle. This triangle is also called a

45-45-90 triangle (named after the angle measures).

4ABC is a right triangle with m6 A = 90◦, AB∼= AC and m6 B = m6 C = 45◦. √

45-45-90 Theorem: If a right triangle is isosceles, the√n its sides are in the ratio x : x : x 2. For any isosceles right

triangle, the legs are x and the hypotenuse is always x 2.

Example A

Find the length of the missing side.

√ √ √

Use the x : x : x 2 ratio. TV = 6 because it is equal to ST . So, SV = 6 · 2 = 6 2.

Example B

Find the length of the missing side.

√ √ √ √

Use the x : x : x 2 ratio. AB = 9 2 because it is equal to AC. So, BC = 9 2 · 2 = 9 ·2 = 18.

Example C

A square has a diagonal with length 10, what are the lengths of the sides?

Draw a picture.

3. x is the hypotenuse of a 45-45-90 triangle with leg lengths of 5 3.
Answers: √
Use th√e x : x : x 2 ratio.
1. 12 2 is the diagonal of the square.√Remember that the diagonal of a square b√isects each angle, so it splits the
square into two 45-45-90 triangles. 12 2 would be the hypotenuse, or equal to x 2.
√ √
12 2 = x 2
12 = x
2. Here, we are given the hypotenuse. Solve for x in the ratio.
√
x 2 = 16 √ √
