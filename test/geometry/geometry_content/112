10.11 Area of Sectors and Segments

Here you'll learn how to find the area of a circle portion that is bounded by either two radii or a chord.

What if you were given a circle with two radii in which the region between those two radii was shaded? How could

you find the area of that shaded region of the circle? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the formula

for the area of a circle's sector to solve problems like this one.

Guidance

A sector of a circle is the area bounded by two radii and the arc between the endpoints of the radii. If r is the radius

and ÂB is the arc bounding a sector, then the area of the sector is A = mÂB360◦ ·pir2.

A segment of a circle is the area of a circle that is bounded by a chord and the arc with the same endpoints as the

chord. The area of a segment is Asegment = Asector−A4ABC

Example A

Find the area of the blue sector. Leave your answer in terms of pi.

In the picture, the central angle that corresponds with the sector is 60◦. 60◦ is 16 of 360

◦, so this sector is 16 of the

total area. area o f blue sector = 16 ·pi82 = 323 pi

Example B

The area of a sector is 8pi and the radius of the circle is 12. What is the central angle?

Plug in what you know to the sector area formula and then solve for the central angle, which we will call x.

2. The radius of√the circle
√ √
is 16, which is also half of the diagonal of the square. So, the diagonal is 32 and the sides
would be 32 · √2 = 16 2 because each half of a square is a 45-45-90 triangle.

Acircle = 1(62pi=√ )256pi2
Asquare = 16 2 = 256 ·2 = 512
The area of the shaded region is 256pi−512≈ 292.25
3. The right angle tells us that this sector represents 14 of the circle. The area of the whole circle is A = pi8
2 = 64pi.
So, the area of the sector is 14 64pi= 16pi.

Summary
This chapter covers perimeter and area of all the basic geometric figures. Perimeter and area are compared and
calculated for rectangles, parallelograms, triangles, and then for composite shapes of those figures. The chapter then
branches into perimeter and area for other special geometric figures, namely trapezoids, rhombuses, and kites, as
well as similar polygons. The chapter continues with the circumference of circles and arc length followed by the area
of a circle and the area of sectors and segments. The chapter wraps up with area and perimeter of regular polygons.

In this chapter we extend what we know about two-dimensional figures to three-dimensional shapes. First, we will

define the different types of 3D shapes and their parts. Then, we will find the surface area and volume of prisms,

cylinders, pyramids, cones, and spheres.
