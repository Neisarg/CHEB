4.1 Triangle Sum Theorem

Here you'll learn how to use the Triangle Sum Theorem, which states that the sum of the angles in any triangle is

180◦.

What if you knew that two of the angles in a triangle measured 55◦? How could you find the measure of the third

angle? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to apply the Triangle Sum Theorem to solve problems like this

one.

The Triangle Sum Theorem says that the three interior angles of any triangle add up to 180◦.

4.1. Triangle Sum Theorem www.ck12.org

m6 1+m 6 2+m6 3 = 180◦

.

Here is one proof of the Triangle Sum Theorem.

←

Given: 4 →ABC with AD||BC

Prove: m6 1+m 6 2+m6 3 = 180◦

TABLE 4.1:

Statement ← Reason

1. 4 →ABC with AD||BC Given

2. 6 1∼= 6 4, 6 2∼= 6 5 Alternate Interior Angles Theorem

3. m6 1 = m6 4, m 6 2 = m6 5 ∼= angles have = measures

4. m6 4+m 6 CAD = 180◦ Linear Pair Postulate

5. m6 3+m 6 5 = m6 CAD Angle Addition Postulate

6. m6 4+m 6 3+m6 5 = 180◦ Substitution PoE

7. m6 1+m 6 3+m6 2 = 180◦ Substitution PoE

You can use the Triangle Sum Theorem to find missing angles in triangles.

Example A

What is m 6 T ?

We know that the three angles in the triangle must add up to 180◦. To solve this problem, set up an equation and

substitute in the information you know.

You can use the Triangle Sum Theorem to find missing angles in triangles.

We know that the three angles in the triangle must add up to 180◦. To solve this problem, set up an equation and
substitute in the information you know.

m6 M+m 6 A+m 6 T = 180◦
82◦+27◦+m6 T = 180◦
109◦+m6 T = 180◦
m6 T = 71◦
Example B
What is the measure of each angle in an equiangular triangle?
To solve, remember that4ABC is an equiangular triangle, so all three angles are equal. Write an equation.
m6 A+m6 B+m 6 C = 180◦
m 6 A+m 6 A+m6 A = 180◦ Substitute, all angles are equal.
3m6 A = 180◦ Combine like terms.
m6 A = 60◦
If m6 A = 60◦, then m 6 B = 60◦ and m6 C = 60◦.
Each angle in an equiangular triangle is 60◦.
Example C
Find the measure of the missing angle.
We know that m 6 O = 41◦ and m6 G = 90◦ because it is a right angle. Set up an equation like in Example A.
m 6 D+m 6 O+m6 G = 180◦
m6 D+41◦+90◦ = 180◦
m6 D+41◦ = 90◦
m6 D = 49◦

Guided Practice
1. Determine m 6 1 in this triangle:
2. Two interior angles of a triangle measure 50◦ and 70◦. What is the third interior angle of the triangle?
3. Find the value of x and the measure of each angle.
Answers:
1. 72◦+65◦+m6 1 = 180◦.
Solve this equation and you find that m6 1 = 43◦.
2. 50◦+70◦+ x = 180◦.
Solve this equation and you find that the third angle is 60◦.
3. All the angles add up to 180◦.
(8x−1)◦+(3x+9)◦+(3x+4)◦ = 180◦
(14x+12)◦ = 180◦
14x = 168
x = 12
Substitute in 12 for x to find each angle.
[3(12)+9]◦ = 45◦ [3(12)+4]◦ = 40◦ [8(12)−1]◦ = 95◦
