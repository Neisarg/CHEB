10.3 Area and Perimeter of Triangles

Here you'll learn how to find the area and perimeter of a triangle given its base and height.

What if you were given a triangle and the size of its base and height? How could you find the total distance around

the triangle and the amount of space it takes up? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the formulas

for the perimeter and area of a triangle to solve problems like this.

Area and Perimeter of Triangles CK-12

Guidance

The formula for the area of a triangle is half the area of a parallelogram.

Area of a Triangle: A = 12 bh or A =

bh

2 .

Example A

Find the area of the triangle.

www.ck12.org Chapter 10. Perimeter and Area

To find the area, we need to find the height of the triangle. We are given two sides of the small right triangle, where

the hypotenuse is also the short side of the obtuse triangle.

32 +h2 = 52

9+h2 = 25

h2 = 16

h = 4

1

A = (4)(7) = 14 units2

2

Example B

Find the perimeter of the triangle in Example A.

To find the perimeter, we need to find the longest side of the obtuse triangle. If we used the black lines in the picture,

we would see that the longest side is also the hypotenuse of the right triangle with legs 4 and 10.

42 +102 = c2

16+100 = c2√

c = 116≈ 10.77

The perimeter is 7+5+10.77≈ 22.77 units

Example C

Find the area of a triangle with base of length 28 cm and height of 15 cm.

The area is 12(28)(15) = 210 cm

Guided Practice
Use the triangle to answer the following questions.
1. Find the height of the triangle.
2. Find the perimeter.
3. Find the area.
Answers:
1. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height.
82 +h2 = 172
h2 = 225
h = 15 in
2. We need to find the hypotenuse. Use the Pythagorean Theorem again.
(8+24)2 +152 = h2
h2 = 1249
h≈ 35.3 in
The perimeter is 24+35.3+17≈ 76.3 in.
3. The area is 12(24)(15) = 180 in
