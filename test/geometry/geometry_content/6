1.6 Angle Classification

Here you'll learn how to classify angles based on their angle measure.

What if you were given the degree measure of an angle? How would you describe that angle based on its size? After

completing this Concept, you'll be able to classify an angle as acute, right, obtuse, or straight.

Guidance

Angles can be grouped into four different categories.

Straight Angle: An angle that measures exactly 180◦.

Acute Angles: Angles that measure between 0◦ and up to but not including 90◦.

Obtuse Angles: Angles that measure more than 90◦ but less than 180◦.

Right Angle: An angle that measures exactly 90◦.

This half-square marks right, or 90◦, angles. When two lines intersect to form four right angles, the lines are

perpendicular. The symbol for perpendicular is ⊥.

Even though all four angles are 90◦, only one needs to be marked with the half-square. l ⊥ m is read line l is

perpendicular to line m.

Example A

What type of angle is 84◦?

84◦ is less than 90◦, so it is acute.

Example B

Name the angle and determine what type of angle it is.

The vertex is U . So, the angle can be 6 TUV or 6 VUT . To determine what type of angle it is, compare it to a right

angle.

Because it opens wider than a right angle and is less than a straight angle, it is obtuse.

Right Angle: An angle that measures exactly 90◦.
This half-square marks right, or 90◦, angles. When two lines intersect to form four right angles, the lines are
perpendicular. The symbol for perpendicular is ⊥.
Even though all four angles are 90◦, only one needs to be marked with the half-square. l ⊥ m is read line l is
perpendicular to line m.
Example A
What type of angle is 84◦?
84◦ is less than 90◦, so it is acute.
Example B
Name the angle and determine what type of angle it is.
The vertex is U . So, the angle can be 6 TUV or 6 VUT . To determine what type of angle it is, compare it to a right
angle.
Because it opens wider than a right angle and is less than a straight angle, it is obtuse.

Example C
What type of angle is 165◦?
165◦ is greater than 90◦, but less than 180◦, so it is obtuse.

For exercises 1-4, determine if the statement is true or false.
1. Two angles always add up to be greater than 90◦.
2. 180◦ is an obtuse angle.
3. 180◦ is a straight angle.
4. Two perpendicular lines intersect to form four right angles.
For exercises 5-10, state what type of angle it is.
5. 55◦
6. 92◦
7. 178◦
8. 5◦
9. 120◦
10. 73◦
In exercises 11-15, use the following information: Q is in the interior of 6 ROS. S is in the interior of 6 QOP. P is in
the interior of 6 SOT . S is in the interior of 6 ROT and m6 ROT = 160◦, m6 SOT = 100◦, and m6 ROQ = m6 QOS =
m6 POT .
