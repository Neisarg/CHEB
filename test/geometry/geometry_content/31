3.10 Distance Formula in the Coordinate Plane

Here you'll learn the Distance Formula and you'll use it to find the distance between two points.

What if you were given the coordinates of two points? How could you find how far apart these two points are? After

completing this Concept, you'll be able to find the distance between two points in the coordinate plane using the

Distance Formula.

James Sousa: The Distance Formula

Guidance

√

The distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) can be defined as d = (x2− x1)2 +(y2− y1)2. This is called

the distance formula. Remember that distances are always positive!

Example A

Find the distance between (4, -2) and (-10, 3).

Plug in (4, -2) for (x1,y1) and (-10, 3) for (x2,y2) and simplify.

√

d = √(−10−4)2 +(3+2)2

= (−14)2 +(5)2

√

= √196+25

= 221≈ 14.87 units

Example B

Find the distance between (3, 4) and (-1, 3).

Plug in (3, 4) for (x1,y1) and (-1, 3) for (x2,y2) and simplify.

√

d = √(−1−3)2 +(3−4)2

= (−4)2 +(−1)2

√

= √16+1

= 17≈ 4.12 units

Example C

Find the distance between (4, 23) and (8, 14).

Plug in (4, 23) for (x1,y1) and (8, 14) for (x2,y2) and simplify.

√

d = √(8−4)2 +(14−23)2

= (4)2 +(−9)2

√

= √16+81

= 97≈ 9.85 units
