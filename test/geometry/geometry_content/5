1.5 Angle Measurement

Here you'll learn how to measure an angle with a protractor and how to apply the Angle Addition Postulate to find

unknown values.

What if you were given the measure of an angle and two unknown quantities that make up that angle? How would

you find the values of those quantities? After completing this Concept, you'll be able to use the Angle Addition

Postulate to evaluate such quantities.

Guidance

An angle is formed when two rays have the same endpoint. The vertex is the common endpoint of the two rays that

form an angle. The sides are the two rays that form an angle.

TABLE 1.7:

Label It Say It

6 ABC Angle ABC

6 CBA Angle CBA

−→ −→

The vertex is B and the sides are BA and BC. Always use three letters to name an angle, 6 SIDE-VERTEX-SIDE.

Angles are measured with something called a protractor. A protractor is a measuring device that measures how

"open" an angle is. Angles are measured in degrees and are labeled with a ◦ symbol. For now, angles are always

positive.

There are two sets of measurements, one starting on the left and the other on the right side of the protractor. Both go

around from 0◦ to 180◦. When measuring angles, you can line up one side with 0◦, and see where the other side hits

the protractor. The vertex lines up in the middle of the bottom line.

Note that if you don't line up one side with 0◦, the angle's measure will be the difference of the degrees where the

sides of the angle intersect the protractor.

Sometimes you will want to draw an angle that is a specific number of degrees. Follow the steps below to draw a
50◦ angle with a protractor:
1. Start by drawing a horizontal line across the page, 2 in long.
2. Place an endpoint at the left side of your line.
3. Place the protractor on this point, such that the line passes through the 0◦ mark on the protractor and the endpoint
is at the center. Mark 50◦ on the appropriate scale.
4. Remove the protractor and connect the vertex and the 50◦ mark.
This process can be used to draw any angle between 0◦ and 180◦. See http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/protr
actor-using.html for an animation of this.
When two smaller angles form to make a larger angle, the sum of the measures of the smaller angles will equal the
measure of the larger angle. This is called the Angle Addition Postulate. So, if B is on the interior of 6 ADC, then
m 6 ADC = m6 ADB+m6 BDC
.

Example A
How many angles are in the picture below? Label each one.
There are three angles with vertex U . It might be easier to see them all if we separate them.
So, the three angles can be labeled, 6 XUY (or 6 YUX), 6 YUZ (or 6 ZUY ), and 6 XUZ (or 6 ZUX).
Example B
Measure the three angles from Example 1, using a protractor.
Just like in Example A, it might be easier to measure these three angles if we separate them.
With measurement, we put an m in front of the 6 sign to indicate measure. So, m 6 XUY = 84◦, m6 YUZ = 42◦ and
m6 XUZ = 126◦.
Example C
What is the measure of the angle shown below?

This angle is lined up with 0◦, so where the second side intersects the protractor is the angle measure, which is 50◦.

Answers
1. This angle is not lined up with 0◦, so use subtraction to find its measure. It does not matter which scale you use,
as long as you are consistent.
Inner scale: 140◦−15◦ = 125◦
Outer scale: 165◦−40◦ = 125◦
2. Lining up one side with 0◦ on the protractor, the other side hits 100◦.
3. Using the Angle Addition Postulate, m 6 QRT = 15◦+30◦ = 45◦.
