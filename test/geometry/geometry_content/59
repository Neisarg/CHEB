6.5 Parallelogram Classification

Here you'll learn what properties differentiate the three special parallelograms: rhombuses, rectangles, and squares.

What if you were given a parallelogram and information about its diagonals? How could you use that information

to classify the parallelogram as a rectangle, rhombus, and/or square? After completing this Concept, you'll be able

to further classify a parallelogram based on its diagonals, angles, and sides.

CK-12 Classifying Parallelograms

Guidance

Rectangles, rhombuses (also called rhombi) and squares are all more specific versions of parallelograms, also called

special parallelograms.

• A quadrilateral is a rectangle if and only if it has four right (congruent) angles.

ABCD is a rectangle if and only if 6 A∼= 6 B∼= 6 C ∼= 6 D.

• A quadrilateral is a rhombus if and only if it has four congruent sides.

ABCD is a rhombus if and only if AB∼= BC ∼=CD∼= AD.

• A quadrilateral is a square if and only if it has four right angles and four congruent sides. By definition, a

square is a rectangle and a rhombus.

ABCD is a square if and only if 6 A∼= 6 B∼= 6 C ∼= 6 D and AB∼= BC ∼=CD∼= AD.

You can always show that a parallelogram is a rectangle, rhombus, or square by using the definitions of these shapes.

There are some additional ways to prove parallelograms are rectangles and rhombuses, shown below:

1) A parallelogram is a rectangle if the diagonals are congruent.

ABCD is parallelogram. If AC ∼= BD, then ABCD is also a rectangle.

2) A parallelogram is a rhombus if the diagonals are perpendicular.

ABCD is a parallelogram. If AC ⊥ BD, then ABCD is also a rhombus.

3) A parallelogram is a rhombus if the diagonals bisect each angle.

ABCD is a parallelogram. If AC bisects 6 BAD and 6 BCD and BD bisects 6 ABC and 6 ADC, then ABCD is also a

rhombus.

Example A
What typed of parallelogram are the figures below?
a)
b)
Answer:
a) All sides are congruent and one angle is 135◦, so the angles are not congruent. This is a rhombus.
b) All four angles are congruent but the sides are not. This is a rectangle.
Example B
Is a rhombus SOMETIMES, ALWAYS, or NEVER a square? Explain why.
A rhombus has four congruent sides and a square has four congruent sides and angles. Therefore, a rhombus is a
square when it has congruent angles. This means a rhombus is SOMETIMES a square.
Example C
List everything you know about the square SQRE.
A square has all the properties of a parallelogram, rectangle and rhombus.

Guided Practice
1. Is a rectangle SOMETIMES, ALWAYS, or NEVER a parallelogram? Explain why.
2. Is a rhombus SOMETIMES, ALWAYS, or NEVER equiangular? Explain why.
3. Is a quadrilateral SOMETIMES, ALWAYS, or NEVER a pentagon? Explain why.
Answers:
1. A rectangle has two sets of parallel sides, so it is ALWAYS a parallelogram.
2. Any quadrilateral, including a rhombus, is only equiangular if all its angles are 90◦. This means a rhombus is
SOMETIMES equiangular, only when it is a square.
3. A quadrilateral has four sides, so it will NEVER be a pentagon with five sides.
